## The Stats

Characters in Paper Story all follow the same general rules. They all have three Stats, and a variety of Skills that fall under the umbrella of those stats.

![](assets/images/icons/heart.png){: .float-left } Heart – your Health Points and physical ability. Characters have 5 HP x their Heart – to a minimum of 1 HP.
{: .text-red-200 .icon-left }

![](assets/images/icons/spirit.png){: .float-left } Spirit – your Flower Points and mental/technical ability. Characters have 5 FP x their Spirit.
{: .text-green-100 .icon-left }

![](assets/images/icons/courage.png){: .float-left } Courage – your Badge Points and spiritual/social ability. Characters have 3 BP x their Courage.

In addition, players have some special stats used for combat, which aren't related to the main three stats.

![](/assets/images/icons/power.png){: .float-left }  
- Power – your raw combat skill and capacity for dealing damage to foes. The base damage for your [Techniques](TODO:LINK) is determined by your Power. You begin play with 1 Power, unless your Species modifies it.

![](/assets/images/icons/attack.png){: .float-left }  
- Attack – how hard you can hit in the heat of the moment. Under most circumstances, your Attack is 0, but it can temporarily go up or down. Every one of your [Strikes](TODO:LINK) are modified by your Attack.

![](/assets/images/icons/defense.png){: .float-left }  
- Defense – whenever you're struck in combat, you reduce the damage by your Defense. You get your full Defense against all strikes made against you, even if they're made by the same attacker. For most species, your beginning Defense is 0, though this can be improved with [Gear](TODO:LINK).

Before we go any further, there's just a few more general rules to cover off:

- Players generally have one "action" per turn, representing something they want to do with the time they have. Usually this warrants a skill check (and thus, rolling dice).  
When there's no time pressure (such as outside of battle), these actions can be resolved in any order.

- If something is measured in "turns", outside of battle, treat 1 turn as being about a minute.

- If a number is divided in any way, unless otherwise specified, round the remainder down to the nearest whole number – to a minimum of 1.  
Be careful, sometimes this will go down to 0! Usually when it would give an unfair advantage for ½ of 1 to wind up the same as ½ of 2. In these cases though the minimum is specified.

Things get a little more complicated in battle, but the following core rules are at the heart of everything in Paper Story!
