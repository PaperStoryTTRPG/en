Players can call on the favour of the Stars to get one up on the competition. 

Players can have up to to *10 SP*{: .courage-color } at a time, or more if their maximum *SP*{: .courage-color } increases, but they begin each session with *0*{: .courage-color }.
Allied players can share their *SP*{: .courage-color } with one another at-will, as long as they're nearby and able to support one another.

In addition to fuelling certain rare and powerful artifacts, *SP*{: .courage-color } can be used on the following special abilities:

{: .content-callout }
> ## Try Again  
>
> By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color }, the Stars can smile on you and give you a second chance!  
>
> When you do this, you can pick up and re-roll any number of dice.  
> You can even use this ability on someone else's dice, to re-roll an enemy's Status check, or to re-roll your own Critical Failure!  
>
> As long as the dice result is open information, it's fair game.

{: .content-callout }
> ## Exceptional Effort  
> 
> By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color }, you can give yourself a sudden burst of inspiration with Exceptional Effort!
>
> You can use this ability at-will, whenever you would make a check, to receive an additional Grade of Success.  
> Multiple uses can be stacked together to add even more Grades of Success!

{: .content-callout }
> ## Second Wind  
> 
> By spending *5 SP or more*{: .courage-color }, you can rally yourself for a Second Wind!
>
> As an action, you can roll 3d6 for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent; divide the total result up into *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, and recover that amount instantly!
>
> You can use this ability whenever you would normally be able to take an action, even if you're currently KO'd!  
> Healing with a Second Wind still doesn't let you recover from a KO'd state, though it can put you in a better position to act once you recover.

{: .content-callout }
> ## Improvise
> 
> By spending *5 SP or more*{: .courage-color }, you can inspire and Improvised Technique!  
> It has to make sense and be something you or your allies could reasonably accomplish, but otherwise, the sky's the limit!
>
> You can use this ability at-will to develop a brand new Technique!  
> If you do this during your turn, you can immediately use that Technique as an action without spending any more *SP*{: .courage-color }.
>
> For the rest of the encounter or scene, you and any nearby allies can use that Technique as an action by spending *½ the SP*{: .courage-color } you spent to improvise it.
>
> When designing an Improvised Technique, the final effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } can't be more than *½ the SP*{: .courage-color } spent.  
> You can include:  
>
> - 1 of your Tech Default sets; as per usual, this doesn't affect the effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
> - Any applicable Optional and Required Tech Defaults you have; Required Tech Defaults must be included, as per usual, and neither affect the effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
> - Up to one *positive*{: .positive-color .underlined } and up to one *negative*{: .negative-color .underlined } Technique Trait for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } you spent.  
> Each new Trait added has to be distinct and unique; you could include multiple variations on *Boost*{: .positive-color }, but not multiple instances of *Strong*{: .positive-color }.
> - If any of the included Traits can be taken multiple times, you can add up to one extra copy for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent.
> - *No matter what*{: .underlined }, the Improvised Technique can't restore *HP*{: .heart-color }, *FP*{: .spirit-color } or *SP*{: .courage-color }.
>
> When you or anyone else uses the Technique, they don't spend any *FP*{: .spirit-color } or even roll for it!  
> For every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } used to design a Technique, its Primary and Secondary Checks automatically earn a Grade of Success.
>
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: A Dash of Inspiration*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Pianta is confronted by a gang of flying Lakitus!  
> > With their Goomba ally KO'd, and no Aerial or Ranged Techniques, he has no choice but to run – or so it would seem.  
> > 
> > By spending *10 SP*{: .courage-color }, the Pianta can improvise a truly impressive Technique!  
> > They include Strong as a Tech Default, then add two additional Traits from their *SP*{: .courage-color } – Ranged, and Strike-Through.  
> > The end result is a Technique with Strong, Ranged and Strike-Through x2 (which is added twice, because of the *SP*{: .courage-color } spent). This would normally have an effective FP cost of *4 FP*{: .spirit-color }, barely less than the *5 FP*{: .spirit-color } limit they had to work with!  
> >
> > With a mighty shotput hurl, they launch the Goomba through as many Lakitus as possible!
