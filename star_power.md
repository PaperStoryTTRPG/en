# Star Power

Players can call on the favour of the Stars to get one up on the competition. 

By default, all players can have up to *10 SP*{: .courage-color } at a time, but they begin each session with *0*{: .courage-color }. Players can share their *SP*{: .courage-color } with one another at-will, as long as they're nearby.

In addition to fuelling certain rare and powerful artifacts, *SP*{: .courage-color } can be used on the following special abilities:

- *Try Again* {: .header-font }  
    By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color } during a check, the Stars can smile on you and give you a second chance! When you do this, you can pick up and re-roll any of your dice, as you see fit.  
    You can even use this ability before Critical Failures trigger!  
    You can use this ability as often as you like during a check.
- *Exceptional Effort*{: .header-font }  
    By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color } after making a check, you can use exceptional effort!  
    You receive an additional Grade of Success on this check.  
    You can boost the same check multiple times, as long as you have enough *SP*{: .courage-color } to spend.
- *Second Wind*{: .header-font }  
    By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color } as an action, you can get a second wind! You can roll 2d6; then you can convert each die into *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color } (your choice on each die) and recover that amount.  
    You can make multiple recovery attempts in the same action, as long as you have enough *SP*{: .courage-color } to spend.
- *Improvise*{: .header-font }  
    By spending *SP*{: .courage-color } as an action, you can improvise a Technique on the fly!  
    Spend *5 SP or more*{: .courage-color } and specify the Technique you want to use.  
    It can include:
    
    - 1 of your Tech Default sets; as per usual, this doesn't affect the effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
    - Any applicable Optional and Required Tech Defaults you have; Required Tech Defaults must be included, as per usual, and neither affect the effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
    - Up to one unique *positive*{: .positive-color .underlined } and up to one unique *negative*{: .negative-color .underlined } Technique Trait for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } you spent.  
    You can add on Traits already included as a Tech Default, but otherwise can't repeat Traits.  
    If the Trait can be taken multiple times and was added here, you can include up to one copy for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent.
    
    The final effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } can't be worth more than *½ the SP spent*{: .courage-color }, so you may have to take on some negative Traits too!  
    Keep in mind when using Technique Traits that include other Traits in their cost (such as *Coin Toss*{: .positive-color }), all the included Traits must be accounted for through *SP*{: .courage-color }.  
    Finally, you use and resolve the Technique! You don't spend any *FP*{: .spirit-color } or even roll for it. The improvised Technique's effectiveness depends entirely on how much *SP*{: .courage-color } you spend, with its Primary and Secondary Checks automatically earning a Grade of Success each for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } you spent.  
    Finally, *no matter what*{: .underlined }, your improvised Technique can't restore *HP*{: .heart-color }, *FP*{: .spirit-color } or *SP*{: .courage-color }.  
    Whatever you improvise, it has to make sense and be something your character could reasonably accomplish; but other than that, the sky's the limit!

> A Pianta is confronted by a gang of flying Lakitus! With their Goomba ally KO'd, and no Aerial or Ranged Techniques, he has no choice but to run – or so it would seem.  
> By spending *10 SP*{: .courage-color }, the Pianta can improvise a truly impressive Technique!  
> They include Strong as a Tech Default, then add two additional Traits from their *SP*{: .courage-color } – Ranged, and Strike-Through.  
> The end result is a Technique with Strong, Ranged and Strike-Through x2 (which is added twice, because of the *SP*{: .courage-color } spent). This would normally have an effective FP cost of *4 FP*{: .spirit-color }, barely less than the *5 FP*{: .spirit-color } limit they had to work with!  
> With a mighty shotput hurl, they launch the Goomba through as many Lakitus as possible!
