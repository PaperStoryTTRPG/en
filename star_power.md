Players can call on the favour of the Stars to get one up on the competition. 

By default, all players can have up to *10 SP*{: .courage-color } at a time, but they begin each session with *0*{: .courage-color }. Allied players can share their *SP*{: .courage-color } with one another at-will, as long as they're nearby.

In addition to fuelling certain rare and powerful artifacts, *SP*{: .courage-color } can be used on the following special abilities:

## Try Again  

By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color }, the Stars can smile on you and give you a second chance! When you do this, you can pick up and re-roll any number of dice. You can even use this ability on someone else's dice, to re-roll an enemy's Status check, or to re-roll your own Critical Failure! As long as the dice result is open information, it's fair game.  
You can use this ability at-will, as often as you like. You can pick up any number of dice as part of the same attempt, but all re-rolled dice must be rolled at the same time.

## Exceptional Effort  

By spending *5 SP*{: .courage-color }, you can give yourself a sudden burst of inspiration with Exceptional Effort!  
You can use this ability at-will, whenever you would make a check, to receive an additional Grade of Success. Multiple uses can be stacked together to add even more Grades of Success!

## Second Wind  

By spending *5 SP or more*{: .courage-color }, you can rally yourself for a Second Wind!  
As an action, you can roll 3d6 for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent; divide the total result up into *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, and recover that amount instantly!  
You can use this ability whenever you would normally be able to take an action, even if you're currently KO'd!

## Improvised Techniques

By spending *5 SP or more*{: .courage-color }, you can inspire an Improvised Technique! It has to make sense and be something you or your allies could reasonably accomplish, but otherwise, the sky's the limit!  
You can use this ability at-will to develop a brand new Technique! If you do this during your turn, you can immediately use that Technique as an action without spending any more *SP*{: .courage-color }.  
For the rest of the encounter or scene, you and any nearby allies can use that Technique as an action by spending *half the SP*{: .courage-color } you spent to improvise it.  
When describing an Improvised Technique, the final effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } can't be more than *half the SP*{: .courage-color } spent. You can include:  
 - 1 of your available Tech Default sets; as per usual, this doesn't affect the effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color }.
 - Any applicable Optional and Required Tech Defaults you have; Required Tech Defaults must be included, as per usual, but neither affect the effective *FP cost*{:. spirit-color }.
 - Up to 1 *Positive*{: .positive-color .underlined } and up to 1 *Negative*{: .negative-color .underlined } Technique Trait for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent.  
Each new Trait added has to be distinct and unique; you could include multiple types of *Boost*{: .positive-color } Traits, but not multiple instances of *Strong*{: .positive-color }.  
 - If any of the included Traits can be taken multiple times, you can add up to 1 extra copy for every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } spent.
 - *No matter what,*{: .underlined } the Improvised Technique can't restore *HP*{: .heart-color }, *FP*{: .spirit-color }, or *SP*{: .courage-color }.
When you or anyone else uses the Technique, they don't spend any *FP*{: .spirit-color } or even roll for it! For every *5 SP*{: .courage-color } used to design a Technique, its Primary and Secondary Checks automatically earn a Grade of Success.

> A Pianta confronted by a game of flying Lakitus! With their Goomba ally KO'd, and no Aerial or Ranged Techniques, he has no choice but to run - or so it would seem.  
> By spending *10 SP*{: .courage-color }, the Pianta can improvise a truly impressive Technique! They include Strong as a Tech Default, then add two additional Traits from their *SP*{: .courage-color } - Ranged, and Strike-Through.  
> The end result is a Technique with Strong, Ranged, and Strike-Through x2 (which is added twice, because of the *SP*{: .courage-color } spent). This would normally have an effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } of *4 FP*{: .spirit-color }, barely less than the *5 FP*{: .spirit-color } limit they had to work with!  
> With a mighty shotput hurl, they immediately launch their Goomba pal through as many Lakitus as possible!
