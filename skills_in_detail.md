Typically, Skills have simple applications, and the outcome of any one check will depend on the Techniques used or the situation it's made in.

Sometimes though it's useful to have hard-and-fast rules for more complicated effects. The Skills suggested here should be considered the default, though depending on the situation, other Skills may be appropriate.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Aim - Item Attacks*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Usually, using consumable Items is fairly straightforward; you take an action to use an Item's effect, and no check is required.  
> However, if you put in some extra effort, you can get a little more out of your Items.  
> Make an *Aim*{: .heart-color } check alongside your Item action. Each Grade of Success earns a point you can spend on any of the following bonus effects.
> Be warned that failing a check will use up the Item without providing any of its usual benefits. Worse still, any result lower than *Great!*{: .great-color } has a risk of backfiring as you throw caution into the wind! It's up to the GM exactly what that risk looks like or how likely it is.
> 
> - 1: This action is safe, and suffers no risk of backfiring. Has no effect on *Great*{: .great-color } or higher results.
> - 1: The Item adds +2 damage onto one of its Strikes; the Item must deal damage in order to choose this effect.
> - 1: Any damage dealt by this Item is Piercing.
> - 1: Add or remove an appropriate Element from this Items' effect.
> - 1: Increase either the Status Level or the duration of one of this Item's Statuses by 1.
> - 2: If this Item wouldn't normally deal damage, it deals 1 Piercing damage to all targets.
> - 2: Add an appropriate Status onto this Item's effect, starting at Status Level 1 and lasting for 3 turns.
> - 3: This Item affects additional targets. If it was a single-target Item, it can affect an entire group. If it was a group-target Item, it can affect all targets outside of the user's group.
> - 3: The Item isn't consumed during this action; it either remains usable or is in some fashion recoverable, though you may have to wait for a spare moment to retrieve it.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Athletics - Fleeing*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Sometimes you need to get away from a fight – but it's never easy to make a clean getaway.  
> Make an *Athletics*{: .heart-color } check; you need at least a Grade of Success for each combatant trying to stay on your tail or otherwise keep you in the fight. In most cases you need at least a *Great!*{: .great-color } result, though if you have allies keeping them at bay or some other support you might be able to get away with less.  
> Keep in mind that just getting away from a turn-based battle doesn't always mean you're in the clear; you might just be turning a fight scene into a chase scene!

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Coordination - Swapping*{: .heart-color }
> 
> In battle, you sometimes want – or need – to swap places with an ally. This takes an action for you to initiate, but the ally you swap places with doesn't need to take any action themselves.  
> Both you and your ally can make a *Coordination*{: .heart-color } check as part of your action; If *either of you*{: .underlined } earn a *Great!*{. great-color } result or better, you cadn treat this as a free action!

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Guard - Defending Actively*{: .heart-color }
> 
> During your turn, you may want to size up the foe and prepare to weather a storm of blows. The best option then is to spend an action to *Defend*{: .heart-color } yourself against future attacks.  
> You make a *Guard*{: .heart-color } check as an action. Until your next turn, your Defense is increased by +1 for each Grade of Success.  
> Since you're concentrating on defense, you even get to *[Guard as a reaction]({{ "/skills_in_detail#guard---guarding-reactively" | absolute_url }})*{: .heart-color } - reducing the damage even further! This means you can't *Defend*{: .heart-color } and *[Dodge]({{ "/skills_in_detail#trickery---dodging" | absolute_url }})*{: .spirit-color } at the same time, though. unless some other effect would let you both *Dodge*{: .spirit-color } and *Guard*{: .heart-color } as a reaction.  
> You don't have to make any more rolls for this *Guard*{: .heart-color } reaction; you instead use the same Grades of Success you earned for this check, as if you'd rolled them for your reaction.
>
> ![](assets/images/scenes/07.png)
> {: .center-img }

> {: .tip-callout }
> > *Defending can seriously improve your Guards, making it easier to go for Superguards! This way you can turn the tables on your enemies instead of just weathering their hits. Sometimes it's better to let them come to you!* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Guard - Guarding Reactively*{: .heart-color }
>
> In battle, you can use *Guard*{: .heart-color } to reduce damage from incoming attacks. At the end of the round, if any attacks are made that target you, you can react with *either*{: .underlined } a *Guard*{: .heart-color } check or a *[Dodge]({{ "/skills_in_detail#trickery---dodging" | absolute_url }})*{: .spirit-color } check.  
> For each Grade of Success, you can reduce the raw damage you would take this round (after applying Defense and Resist) by 1 point. If you're being target by multiple strikes, you can assign this damage reduction to any of them as you see fit.  
> By *Guarding*{: .heart-color } you can even ignore an attack's Status effects! When you reduce an attack's damage to 0 (or less), and you don't have any Weaknesses to consider, you can ignore its Status effects. Otherwise you may have to resist them with *[Steady]({{ "/skills_in_detail#steady---resisting-effects" | absolute_url }})*{: .courage-color }, even if your Defense nullified the damage.
>
> If you have a relevant Weakness, its effects are applied after you finish *Guarding*{: .heart-color } - even if you reduced the damage to 0.
>
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Guarding Weaknesses*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Piranha Plant is attacked by a Fire Bro's fireball, dealing 2 damage, and a Paragoomba's dive, dealing 1 damage.  
> > The Piranha Plant reacts by *Guarding*{: .heart-color } and gets a *Good*{: .good-color } result, allowing them to block 2 points of damage.  
> > The Piranha Plant can block the Fire Bro's initial attack completely, but they still have a Weakness to Fire, so they have to take an extra +2 damage from their Weakness, and then 1 more damage from the Paragoomba!
>
> With exceptional *Guarding*{: .heart-color }, though, you can turn the tables with a *Superguard*{: .heart-color }! If your *Guarding*{: .heart-color } would reduce a strike's damage below 0, it triggers a *Superguard*{: .heart-color } instead.  
> *Superguards*{: .heart-color } completely ignore all damage, Statuses, and other effects from an attack. They even ignore your own Weaknesses!  
> If the attacker struck you in melee, you interrupt their attack and deal 1 Piercing damage back at them. And if they attacked at range, you can reflect the strike's raw damage back at them!
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Superguard*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Koopa is attacked by a Goomba's leaping headbonk (dealing 1 damage), and a Clubba's swing (dealing 3 damage).  
> > The Koopa has 1 Defense, and *Guards*{: .heart-color } as a reaction with a *Good*{: .good-color } result; in between their Defense and their *Guard*{: .heart-color } result they could block all damage, but they have a Weakness to Aerial attacks - they would still be flipped by the Goomba's headbonk, which would nullify their Defense against the Clubba's attack.  
> > Instead, the Koopa *Superguards*{: .heart-color } the Goomba's attack, using their Defense and one Grade of Success to reduce the damage below 0. This way they can stay standing, giving them 1 Defense and 1 Grade from their *Guard*{: .heart-color } result against the Clubba's attack.

> ## *Heal - First Aid*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Restoring your health is usually very simple; most of the time getting some rest in a comfortable place is enough to fully restore *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, as well as recover from [Status]({{ "/statuses" | absolute_url }}) ailments.  
> But if you're under pressure and need to patch someone up right away, you can always try some *First Aid*{: .heart-color }  
> As an action, make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check; each Grade of Success restores *2 HP*{: .heart-color } to the target and/or reduces a Status' duration by 1 turn.  
> If this would restore a KO'd target back to full health, they're revived on the spot!
>
> *First Aid*{: .heart-color } is only really useful as an initial response, so it gets a little harder each time you try; each time you carry out *First Aid*{: .heart-color } on a target, the required Grades of Success increase by 1. This penalty lasts until the target gets some proper rest.  
> If your *First Aid*{: .heart-color } attempt fails, you instead cause them to lose 1 HP for each Grade you failed by. Or worse, if you fail spectacularly.
>
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Recovery*{: .header-font }
> >
> > After a tough fight, a Dayzee's ally is injured and still suffering from a poison for 4 more turns.  
> > The Dayzee makes a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check to administer First Aid, with a *Good*{: .spirit-color } result.  
> > They're able to restore *4 HP*{: .heart-color } and reduce the poison to 2 turns.  
> > In the time it takes to perform First Aid, their ally suffers from another turn of poison (reducing the duration to 1 turn) – the Dayzee makes another *Heal*{: .heart-color } check, but only gets a *Nice*{: .nice-color } result. Because they've already administered First Aid once, this isn't enough, and they end up hurting their ally instead.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Heal - Administering Medicine*{: .heart-color }
>
> Usually, using consumable Items on yourself or an ally is faily straightforward; you take an action to use an Item's effect, and no check is required.  
> However, if you have the skills to back it up, you can get a little more out of your *Booster*{: .booster } or *Curative*{: .curative } Items.  
> Make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check alongside your Item action. Each Grade of Success earns a point you can spend on any of the following bonus effects.  
> Be warned that failing a check will use up the Item without providing any of its usual benefits. Worse still, any result lower than *Great!*{: .great-color } has a risk of backfiring from your brazen actions! It's up to the GM exactly what that risk looks like, or how likely it is.  
> Note that *Heal*{: .heart-color } can't be used to improve Items consumed automatically, such as a Life Shroom.  
>
> - 1: This action is safe, and suffers no risk of backfiring. Has no effect on *Great!*{: .great-color} or higher results.
> - 1: Choose *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color }; if this Item didn't restore that before, it restores *+5 HP*{: .heart-color } or *+5 FP*{: .spirit-color} to each target.
> - 1: The Item adds one fifth of its base *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color } restoring effects onto each heal, including gradual effects (like a Slow Shroom or Gradual Syrup).
> - 1: You can share the use of this Item with another valid target, exactly as if the Item was used on them.
> - 1: This Item cures all targets of one Status of their choice.
> - 1: Increase the Status Level of one of this Item's Statuses, or the numerical effects of oen of this Item's Traits by +1.
> - 1: Increase the duration of one of this Item's Statuses or Traits by 1 turn.
> - 2: Add an appropriate Status onto this Item's effect, starting at Status Level 1 and lasting for 3 turns.
> - 2: This Item provides its targets with an appropriate Personal Trait, lasting for 3 turns. Its numerical values (e.g. damage resisted) begin at 1.
> - 3: This Item immediately revives any KO'd targets; if the Item doesn't heal *HP*{: .heart-color }, the targets are revived with *1 HP*{: .heart-color }.
> - 3: This Item isn't consumed duringn this action; you're able to use just enough of it to ensure you get the full effects while preserving enough for another dose.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Crafts - Working from Scratch*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> *Crafts*{: .spirit-color } (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to develop usable products from raw materials, which may otherwise be useless.
> 
> First, choose an Item, Power-Up, Badge or Gear you want to make and have the materials for.
> 
> A *Nice*{: .nice-color } result is enough to make something with an equivalent value of 5 Coins; for each Grade of Success earned, you can double the value range of the Items you can make, as follows:
> 
> - *Nice!*{: .nice-color }: 5 Coins
> - *Good!*{: .good-color }: 10 Coins
> - *Great!*{: .great-color }: 20 Coins
> - *Wonderful!*{: .wonderful-color }: 40 Coins
> - *Excellent!*{: .excellent-color }: 80 Coins
> - *Unbelievable!*{: .unbelievable-color }: 160 Coins
> 
> Failure consumes all materials involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes.
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Crafting Gear*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Koopa smithy wants to smith a Super Hammer. Super Gear costs a whopping 400 Coins, so this is a tall order, but it's well worth the effort.  
> > They earn a *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } result, for an equivalent of 40 Coins; an impressive outcome but only a fifth of the way there.  
> > They try to push themselves to keep working, and earn a *Great*{: .great-color } result on the second check; this only adds on 10 Coins, for a total of 50.  
> > They decide to set the project aside before they make a Mistake, but take pride that their new Gear is 1/8 complete.
> 
> Once you've created something or otherwise know how it's made, it becomes easier to craft, with value starting from 10 Coins on a *Nice*{: .nice-color } result.  
> In any case, one attempt to *Craft*{: .spirit-color } can only produce one Item, Gear or Power-Up at a time, and can't produce enhanced or mixed Items.
> 
> Depending on the quality of the materials you use, you may be able to craft Items with less Grades of Success than normal; however, appropriate materials must always be sourced and used up.
> 
> As a general rule, when it comes to materials:
> 
> - [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}) can be made with common materials which can be sourced on the cheap in most settlements, costing no more than half the Item's value.
> - [Badges]({{ "/inventory#badges" | absolute_url }}) and [Gear]({{ "/inventory#gear" | absolute_url }}) require more valuable and rarer materials, which may take more work to find on the market, or require the crafter to seek them out in the field.
> - [Power-Ups]({{ "/inventory#power-ups" | absolute_url }}) require some form of magical charge, either taken from rare materials, or crafted with [*Magic*{: .spirit-color }]({{ "/skills_in_detail#magic---spontaneous-spells" | absolute_url }}) assistance (as a Skill Substitution or Skill Enhancement; if you have an ally assisting, you don't necessarily have to do the magic yourself).
> 
> If you don't achieve a high enough result, you can either settle for a similar product you could have made with the materials you used instead (such as settling for a Mushroom over a Super Mushroom), accept failure and make a Mistake, or take the time to make another check; each additional check made in this way takes more time, and successive checks without rest require a higher Grade of Success.

> ## *Crafts - Enhancing and Mixing*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> In addition to creating things from scratch, *Crafts*{: .spirit-color } (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to enhance or combine consumable [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}).  
> For each Grade of Success, you can choose one of the following effects to apply to the new Item:
> 
> - Consume another Item, adding *all*{: .underlined } of its effects (*HP*{: .heart-color }, *FP*{: .spirit-color }, gradual recovery, damage, Status, etc.) to the new Item, using the first Item's targets.  
> *No matter what*{: .underlined }, you can't combine more than two Items at once.
> - Increase an existing *HP*{: .heart-color } and/or *FP*{: .spirit-color } recovery effect by 2.
> - Increase the Item's damage by 1 (if it would deal damage).
> - Add an Element or replace an existing Element, changing the type of damage dealt.
> - Add a Status, or increase an existing Status Level by 1.  
> New Statuses have the same duration as the original Item's Statuses (if applicable), lasting up to a minimum of 1 turn.
> - Increase the duration of all the Item's Statuses and other effects by 1 turn.  
> 
> Failure instead consumes all Items involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes.

> 
> Once you've created an Item or otherwise know its recipe, it becomes easier to make it again, requiring half as many Grades of Success (to a minimum of *Nice*{: .nice-color }).

> ## *Knowhow - Tattling on Foes*{: .spirit-color }
>
> Characters with *Knowhow*{: .spirit-color } are savvy individuals, and usually know a thing or two about their enemies - though it might take them some time to recall, or they might need to check their notes.  
> By making a *Knowhow*{: .spirit-color } check as an action, you can figure out some of the qualities of a place, character, or hazard. Where appropriate you may be able to use other skills to Tattle, such as *Notice*{: .spirit-color } or *Persuade*{: .courage-color }, but the type of information you can learn may depend on the skill you used.  
> You can divide your Grades of Success up between multiple targets. For each target, you learn information based on the total Grades of Success assigned, as well as any information you could have with less Grades.  
> No matter how many targets you Tattle on, if you only allocate *Great!*{: .great-color } results or better you can treat this as a free action!
>
> - *Nice!*{: .nice-color }: You know general information about things similar to the target, but not the target specifically. You can at best determine a couple fun facts and their current and maximum *HP*{: .heart-color }, and can easily track their current *HP*{: .heart-color } going forwards.
> - *Good!*{: .good-color }: You know a little about the specific target, including some of their main methods of attack, their Defense and any general danger they may pose.
> - *Great!*{: .great-color }: You know specialised information about the target, including their Immunities, Resistances or Weaknesses, and usually some juicy gossip.
> - *Wonderful!*{: .wonderful-color }: You know just about all that you could reasonably determine about the target, including all of their attacks, common strategies, and equiment available to them - or that you might be able to take from them!
> - *Excellent!*{: .excellent-color }: You can glean all sorts of useful information about the target, including the sorts of details only an expert could know!

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Magic - Spontaneous Spells*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> *Magic*{: .spirit-color }'s most powerful quality is its versatility – the ability to do *anything!*{: .underlined }  
> These rules apply whenever you would cast a spell that's not already a key part of your repertoire, like a Technique, representing the challenging art of spontaneous casting.
> 
> Whatever kind of spell you cast, you choose beforehand how much of your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool to use and *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } to "unlock"; this includes dice you receive from your Skill and your relevant Specialisations.  
> Note though you don't have to pay or unlock situational or temprary bonuses, like the aid you'd get from someone's assistance, a *Boost*{: .booster } Status, or the extra *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } you get from a Spirit Plus Badge.  
> 
> - To unlock up to 1 of your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dice and up to 2 of your *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } points, pay *3 FP*{: .spirit-color } at a time.  
> - If you have a relevant Specialisation, you pay *2 FP*{: .spirit-color } at a time instead.  
> - If you have a relevant Efficient trait, you only pay *1 FP*{: .spirit-color } at a time.  
> - If this spell would be restricted by one or more Devotion Traits, you pay twice as much *FP*{: .spirit-color } overall.
> - No matter the circumstances, you *always*{: .underlined } pay at least as much *FP*{: .spirit-color } as one d6 or point of *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } would cost.  
>
> Then just like a normal check, roll your dicepool, and nudge it along with your unlocked *Spirit*{: .spirit-color }.
> Keep in mind though that *no matter what*{: .underlined }, *Magic*{: .spirit-color } spells can't be used to gain or bestow *FP*{: .spirit-color } or *SP*{: .courage-color } (besides the *SP*{: .courage-color } you'd earn from an [Exceptional Result]({{ "/grades_of_success#exceptional-results" | absolute_url }})).
> 
> - *Skill Substitution*{: .header-font }  
  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to emulate other skills, such as *Athletics*{: .heart-color }, *Notice*{: .spirit-color } or *Bully*{: .courage-color }, by making a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check instead – completely replacing the check you'd make with your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } pool. Since this is a magical effect it can even offset the penalties you'd normally have to endure!
>
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Substituted Skills*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Cleft witch finds themselves stranded on a river bank while their Koopa companion swims across. They have no *Athletics*{: .heart-color } to speak of, and their dense stone body isn't great at swimming, but they do have *3 Magic*{: .spirit-color } and a specialisation in Terraforming.  
> > Instead of swimming across, they conjure a stone bridge to walk across - paying *8 FP*{: .spirit-color } to use all four *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dice at their disposal. Better still, if any of their other al0lies needed a ride, they could walk across the bridge too!
>
> - *Skill Enhancement*{: .header-font }  
  When an ally makes a non-Magic check, you can enhance it with *Magic*{: .spirit-color }. You can even enhance your own checks, if it's something you're already skilled in. This works as if you simultaneously made the check with your action, and were assisted by yourself using your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } as a free action. You pay *FP*{: .spirit-color } to unlock your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } and *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } as normal, then add half of that dicepool (to a minimum of 0) and up to your unlocked *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } onto the main Skill check.

> > They can pay *6 FP*{: .spirit-color } to use their two *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dice; as they're assisting themselves, they add half of that onto their main *Guard*{: .heart-color } dicepool, for +1d6 and a total of 2d6.  
> > The dice come up 1 and 2; since they can use both their *Heart*{: .heart-color } and their *Spirit*{: .spirit-color }, this is enough to boost both dice to 4's for a *Good*{: .good-color } result! Their tough shell is bolstered with a glyph of warding.

> 
> - *Enchantments*{: .header-font }  
  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to temporarily enchant targets with [Personal Traits]({{ "/personal_traits" | absolute_url }}), such as Fly, Invisibility or Mimicry.  
  Make a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check and choose a Personal Trait; if you succeed, the target receives the chosen Trait, lasting a number of turns equal to your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool or *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } statpool (whichever's higher).  
  Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher.  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   
>   - The Enchantment lasts for one more turn.
>   - The Enchantment includes another Trait.
>   - A numerical value of one of the Traits increases by +1.
>   - One of the Traits includes one more element (if applicable).
>   - The Enchantment affects one more valid target.
> 
> If the target already has a Trait they would receive from this enchantment, the enchantment temporarily overrides their Trait; this can be used to substitute existing Immunities and Resistances.
>

  Similarly, *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to temporarily neutralise the target's qualities and other Personal Traits.  
  Make a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check and choose a quality the target has (e.g. a Personal Trait, a Status delivered by their attack, or an elemental affinity of their attack); if you succeed, the target suffers a Curse as if it was a Status, temporarily neutralising their ability to use that quality in some fashion. They can recover as normal, such as with [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}) or [*Steady*{: .courage-color }]({{ "/skills_in_detail#steady---resisting-effects" | absolute_url }}), and players can make a *Steady*{: .courage-color } check to resist as a reaction, just like any other Status.  
  The Curse lasts a number of turns equal to your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool or *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } statpool (whichever's higher).  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   - The Curse lasts for one more turn.
>   - The Curse includes another quality.
>   - The Curse affects one more valid target.

> > They choose to remove the Paratroopas' ability to fly, equivalent to the Fly Trait. With their Grades of Success, they're able to ground each of their enemies. Since their *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool of 4 is higher than their *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } of 3, the effect lasts for a total of 4 turns.

  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can even be used to improvise Techniques on the fly! Instead of making any Technique checks, you make one *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check to conjure up an effect; as long as you succeed, this Technique begins with 1 Grade of Success in any of its Primary or Secondary checks, 1 Power (regardless of your own), and an effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } of 0.  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   - Add *3 FP*{: .spirit-color } to the final Technique's effective cost.
>   - Add a Grade of Success to the outcome of the Technique's Primary and/or Secondary Checks.
>   - Add +1 Power.
> 
> You can select up to your dicepool or *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } pool (whichever's higher) in positive Traits, and the same amount again in negative Traits, as long as the *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } for the combined Traits doesn't exceed the effective cost.

> As this isn't an Innate Technique, and you're not directly attacking, it works a bit differently to a normal attack.  
> None of your own Tech Defaults are included in the Technique, you don't include your Attack modifier, and you can't benefit from *[Exceptional Techniques]({{ "/exceptional_techniques" | absolute_url }})*{: .courage-color }.  
> You can however add *Indirect*{: .positive-color }, *Ranged*{: .positive-color }, and/or *Harmless*{: .negative-color } as Tech Defaults for no additional cost; this is simply the nature of *Magic*{: .spirit-color }.

They want the hex to stop all their enemies in their tracks, so they add *Group*{: .positive-color }, *Lengthen*{: .positive-color } and *Daze x3*{: .positive-color }, giving the hex an effective cost of *8 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
> > They don't need it to deal any damage though, and they're sure it will work without a hitch; so they give it the negative Traits *Harmless*{: .negative-color } and *Commitment*{: .negative-color }, reducing the effective cost to just *3 FP*{: .spirit-color }.
