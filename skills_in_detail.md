Typically, Skills have simple applications, and the outcome of any one check will depend on the Techniques used or the situation it's made in.

Sometimes though it's useful to have hard-and-fast rules for more complicated effects. The Skills suggested here should be considered the default, though depending on the situation, other Skills may be appropriate.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Aim - Item Attacks*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Usually, using consumable Items is fairly straightforward; you take an action to use an Item's effect, and no check is required.  
> However, if you put in some extra effort, you can get a little more out of your Items.  
> Make an *Aim*{: .heart-color } check (or other appropriate Skill) alongside your Item action.  
> Each Grade of Success earns a point you can spend on any of the following bonus effects; however, be warned that any result lower than Great has a risk of backfiring as you throw caution to the wind. It's up to the GM exactly what that risk looks like or how likely it is.
> 
> - 1: This action is safe, and suffers no risk of backfiring. Has no effect on *Great*{: .great-color } or higher results.
> - 1: The Item adds ¼ of its damage onto its total damage; the Item must deal damage in order to choose this effect.
> - 1: Increase the Status Level of one of this Item's Statuses by 1.
> - 1: Increase the duration of one of this Item's Statuses by 1 turn.
> - 2: Add an appropriate Status onto this Item's effect, starting at Status Level 1 and lasting for 3 turns.
> - 2: The Item isn't consumed during this action; it either remains useable or is in some fashion recoverable, but you may have to wait for a spare moment to retrieve it.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Athletics - Fleeing*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Sometimes you need to get away from a fight – but it's never easy.  
> To make a clean getaway, you need a Grade of Success for each combatant trying to stay on your tail or otherwise keeping you in the fight. Regardless, you always need at least a *Great*{: .great-color } result.  
> Keep in mind that just getting away from a turn-based battle doesn't mean you're in the clear – you might just be turning a fight scene into a chase scene!

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Coordination - Swapping*{: .heart-color }
> 
> In battle, you sometimes want – or need – to swap places with an ally. Swapping only requires the initiating character to use their action. This action doesn't require any checks, but if both players make a *Coordination*{: .heart-color } check with at least a *Great*{: .great-color } result, this becomes a free action!

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Guard - Reducing Damage*{: .heart-color }
> 
> In battle, you can use *Guard*{: .heart-color } to reduce damage from incoming attacks. Either on your turn (as an action) or at the end of the round (as a reaction, in response to incoming attacks), make a *Guard*{: .heart-color } check.
>
> If you choose to *Block*{: .heart-color }, you can't *Dodge*{: .spirit-color } incoming attacks in the same round, unless an [Item]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}) or other effect would allow it.
> 
> - *Blocking*{: .header-font }  
    For each Grade of Success, you can ignore 1 point of damage this turn.  
    You can choose which attacks have their damage reduced at-will.  
    If you *Guarded*{: .heart-color } as an action, you also receive +1 Defense for each Grade of Success until next round.  
    If you reduce an attack's damage to 0 by blocking, and no Weaknesses apply, you can't suffer any Status effects from it, which might otherwise apply if you're simply tanking it with Defense.  
    Bear in mind though that the effects of your Weaknesses still apply, even if you reduced the initial damage to 0.
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Blocking*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Bob-Omb is attacked by a Fire Bro's fireball, dealing 2 damage, and a Paragoomba's dive, dealing 1 damage.  
> > The Bob-Omb reacts by blocking, and gets a *Good*{: .good-color } result, allowing them to block 2 points of damage.  
> > The Bob-Omb can block the Fire Bro's initial attack completely, but they still have a Weakness to Fire, so they have to take an extra +2 damage from their Weakness, and then 1 damage from the Paragoomba.
>
> ![](assets/images/scenes/07.png)
> {: .center-img }
>
> {: .tip-callout }
> > *Blocking helps protect you from all manner of attacks – even if they would pierce through your Defense. Keep in mind though that you get one Guard check to resist **all**{: .underlined } attacks for the round – the more pressure you're under, the harder it'll be to shrug off the damage!* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)
> > {: .icon-right }
>
> - *Superguard*{: .header-font }  
    If you've reduced an attack's damage to 0 in any way (such as by blocking or through your Defense), blocking it with one more point of damage reduction allows you to make a Superguard against that attack.  
    Superguards are more potent blocks, allowing you to completely ignore all damage and Statuses from the attack and even ignore your own Weakness!  
    Better still, you can interrupt your attacker by dealing damage, stopping them from making more attacks. If the attacker struck you in melee, you interrupt any more attacks they would have made and deal 1 Piercing damage back at them. And if they attacked at range, you can reflect the full attack's damage back at them!
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Superguard*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Koopa is attacked by a Goomba's leaping headbonk, dealing 1 damage, and a Clubba's melee attack, dealing 3 damage.  
> > The Koopa has 1 Defense, and blocks as a reaction with a *Good*{: .good-color } result; in between their Defense and their *Guard*{: .heart-color } result they could block all damage, but they have a Weakness to Aerial attacks. The Goomba could flip them over and completely expose them to the Clubba's attack!  
> > Instead, the Koopa Superguards the Goomba's attack with one Grade of Success, interrupting it and letting them ignore their Weakness. Then they can keep their Defense and block the Clubba's attack, reducing damage to 1.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Heal - Recovery*{: .heart-color }
> 
> Recovering in Paper Story is generally very simple; most of the time, getting some rest is enough to fully restore *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color } and recover from [Status]({{ "/statuses" | absolute_url }}) effects.  
> However, if you need to recover in the field, or want to use a healing Item more effectively, you can make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check.
> 
> - *First Aid*{: .header-font }  
    As an action, make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check; each Grade of Success restores *2 HP*{: .heart-color } to the target and/or reduces a Status' duration by 1 turn.  
    However, First Aid is only really useful as an initial response – each time you perform First Aid on a target, the required Grades of Success increase by 1 until they get some rest.  
    If you *fail*{: .italic } a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check like this, you instead cause them to lose HP equal to ½ your Power. Or worse, if you fail spectacularly.
>
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Recovery*{: .header-font }
> >
> > After a tough fight, a Dayzee's ally is injured and still suffering from a poison for 4 more turns.  
> > The Dayzee makes a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check to administer First Aid, with a *Good*{: .spirit-color } result.  
> > They're able to restore *4 HP*{: .heart-color } and reduce the poison to 2 turns.  
> > In the time it takes to perform First Aid, their ally suffers from another turn of poison (reducing the duration to 1 turn) – the Dayzee makes another *Heal*{: .heart-color } check, but only gets a *Nice*{: .nice-color } result. Because they've already administered First Aid once, this isn't enough, and they end up hurting their ally instead.
> 
> - *Administering Medicine*{: .header-font }  
    When using an Item to restore a target's *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color }, you can make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check alongside your Item action; each Grade of Success adds a quarter of the *HP*{: .heart-color }/*FP*{: .spirit-color } restoring properties of the Item to the target. This includes all healing applications, including healing over time like Slow Shrooms or Gradual Syrups, but the Item has to already restore *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color } respectively.  
    If you *fail*{: .italic } a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check like this, you just waste the Item; if you fail spectacularly there might be worse consequences, too.
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Medicinal Aid*{: .header-font }
> >
> > In the middle of a tough battle, a Boo wizard is seriously injured and low on energy. Their Squeek ally pulls out a Honey Mushroom for them, which would heal *5 HP*{: .heart-color } and *5 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
> > They use the Honey Mushroom on their Boo ally, and try to boost it with a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check, earning a *Good*{: .good-color } result. For each Grade of Success, they add ¼ of 5 to *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, which rounded down would be 1.  
> > So for 3 Grades of Success, they add *+3 HP*{: .heart-color } and *+3 FP*{: .spirit-color }, for a total of *8 HP*{: .heart-color } and *8 FP*{: .spirit-color }.
> 
> {: .tip-callout }
> > *It's difficult to find the time in battle to heal. Usually it's better to prevent damage by focusing on your attacks, and to worry about healing afterwards; but if you neglect your health, you'll be sure to regret it further down the line* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Crafts - Working from Scratch*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> *Crafts*{: .spirit-color } (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to develop useable products from raw materials, which may otherwise be useless.
> 
> First, choose an Item, Power-Up, Badge or Gear you want to make and have the materials for.
> 
> A *Nice*{: .nice-color } result is enough to make something with an equivalent value of 5 Coins; for each Grade of Success earned, you can double the value range of the Items you can make, as follows:
> 
> - *Nice!*{: .nice-color }: 5 Coins
> - *Good!*{: .good-color }: 10 Coins
> - *Great!*{: .great-color }: 20 Coins
> - *Wonderful!*{: .wonderful-color }: 40 Coins
> - *Excellent!*{: .excellent-color }: 80 Coins
> - *Unbelievable!*{: .unbelievable-color }: 160 Coins
> 
> Failure consumes all materials involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes.
> 
> {: .example-callout}
> > *Example: Crafting Gear*{: .header-font }
> >
> > A Koopa smithy wants to smith a Super Hammer. Super Gear costs a whopping 400 Coins, so this is a tall order, but it's well worth the effort.  
> > They earn a *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } result, for an equivalent of 40 Coins; an impressive outcome but only a fifth of the way there.  
> > They try to push themselves to keep working, and earn a *Great*{: .great-color } result on the second check; this only adds on 10 Coins, for a total of 50.  
> > They decide to set the project aside before they make a Mistake, but take pride that their new Gear is 1/8 complete.
> 
> Once you've created something or otherwise know how it's made, it becomes easier to craft, with value starting from 10 Coins on a *Nice*{: .nice-color } result.  
> In any case, one attempt to *Craft*{: .spirit-color } can only produce one Item, Gear or Power-Up at a time, and can't produce enhanced or mixed Items.
> 
> Depending on the quality of the materials you use, you may be able to craft Items with less Grades of Success than normal; however, appropriate materials must always be sourced and used up.
> 
> As a general rule, when it comes to materials:
> 
> - [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}) can be made with common materials which can be sourced on the cheap in most settlements, costing no more than half the Item's value.
> - [Badges]({{ "/inventory#badges" | absolute_url }}) and [Gear]({{ "/inventory#gear" | absolute_url }}) require more valuable and rarer materials, which may take more work to find on the market, or require the crafter to seek them out in the field.
> - [Power-Ups]({{ "/inventory#power-ups" | absolute_url }}) require some form of magical charge, either taken from rare materials, or crafted with [*Magic*{: .spirit-color }]({{ "/skills_in_detail#magic---spontaneous-spells" | absolute_url }}) assistance (as a Skill Substitution or Skill Enhancement; if you have an ally assisting, you don't necessarily have to do the magic yourself).
> 
> If you don't achieve a high enough result, you can either settle for a similar product you could have made with the materials you used instead (such as settling for a Mushroom over a Super Mushroom), accept failure and make a Mistake, or take the time to make another check; each additional check made in this way takes more time, and successive checks without rest require a higher Grade of Success.

> ## *Crafts - Enhancing and Mixing*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> In addition to creating things from scratch, *Crafts*{: .spirit-color } (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to enhance or combine consumable [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}).  
> For each Grade of Success, you can choose one of the following effects to apply to the new Item:
> 
> - Consume another Item, adding *all*{: .underlined } of its effects (*HP*{: .heart-color }, *FP*{: .spirit-color }, gradual recovery, damage, Status, etc.) to the new Item, using the first Item's targets.  
> *No matter what*{: .underlined }, you can't combine more than two Items at once.
> - Increase an existing *HP*{: .heart-color } and/or *FP*{: .spirit-color } recovery effect by 2.
> - Increase the Item's damage by 1 (if it would deal damage).
> - Add an Element or replace an existing Element, changing the type of damage dealt.
> - Add a Status, or increase an existing Status Level by 1.  
> New Statuses have the same duration as the original Item's Statuses (if applicable), lasting up to a minimum of 1 turn.
> - Increase the duration of all the Item's Statuses and other effects by 1 turn.  
> 
> Failure instead consumes all Items involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes.

{: .content-callout }
> ## *Magic - Spontaneous Spells*{: .spirit-color }
> 
> *Magic*{: .spirit-color }'s most powerful quality is its versatility – the ability to do *anything*{: .underlined }!  
> These rules apply whenever you would cast a spell that's not already a key part of your repertoire, like a Technique, representing the challenging art of spontaneous casting.
> 
> Whatever kind of spell you cast, you choose beforehand how much of your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool to use; this includes dice you receive from your Skill, your relevant Specialisations and Boosts to your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } skill.  
> It doesn't include situational bonuses, though, like the extra dice you'd get for someone's assistance. Spontaneous Spells also don't rely on Tech Defaults, including Optional or Required ones, and aren't impacted by Tutor.
> 
> For each die included in your pool, you pay *3 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
> If you have a relevant Specialisation, you pay *2 FP*{: .spirit-color } per die instead, and if you have a relevant Efficient trait, you only pay *1 FP*{: .spirit-color } per die.  
> No matter the circumstances, you *always*{: .underlined } pay at least as much *FP*{: .spirit-color } as one die would cost.  
> Regardless, the final roll is modified by your *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } as normal for a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check.
>
> Keep in mind though that *no matter what*{: .underlined }, *Magic*{: .spirit-color } spells can't be used to gain or bestow *FP*{: .spirit-color } or *SP*{: .courage-color } ([Exceptional Results]({{ "/grades_of_success#exceptional-results" | absolute_url }}) aside).
> 
> - *Skill Substitution*{: .header-font }  
  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to emulate other skills, such as *Athletics*{: .heart-color }, *Notice*{: .spirit-color } or *Bully*{: .courage-color }, by making a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check instead – completely replacing the check you'd make with your Magic pool.
> 
> - *Skill Enhancement*{: .header-font }  
  As long as you would normally have dice for the check, you can enhance it with *Magic*{: .spirit-color }; this works as if you made the check, and were also assisted by yourself using your *Magic*{: .spirit-color }.  
  You pay *FP*{: .spirit-color } to access your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dicepool as normal, then add ½ of that dicepool (to a minimum of 0) and your *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } onto the main Skill check.  
  Even if the main check used *Spirit*{: .spirit-color }, you can still add your *Spirit*{: .spirit-color } again!

> > They can pay *6 FP*{: .spirit-color } to use their two *Magic*{: .spirit-color } dice; as they're assisting themselves, they add half of that onto their main *Guard*{: .heart-color } dicepool, for +1d6 and a total of 2d6.  
> > The dice come up 1 and 2; since they can use both their *Heart*{: .heart-color } and their *Spirit*{: .spirit-color }, this is enough to boost both dice to 4's for a *Good*{: .good-color } result.
> >
> 
> - *Enchantments*{: .header-font }  
  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to temporarily enchant targets with [Personal Traits]({{ "/personal_traits" | absolute_url }}), such as Fly, Invisibility or Mimicry.  
  Make a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check and choose a Personal Trait; if you succeed, the target receives the chosen Trait, lasting for 1 turn for each *Magic*{: .spirit-color } die you used.  
  Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher.  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   
>   - The Enchantment lasts for one more turn.
>   - The Enchantment includes another Trait.
>   - A numerical value of one of the Traits increases by +1.
>   - One of the Traits includes one more element (if applicable).
>   - The Enchantment affects one more valid target.
> 
>   If the target already has a Trait they would receive from this enchantment, the enchantment temporarily overrides their Trait; this can be used to substitute existing Immunities and Resistances.
> 
>  You have to specify any particulars of the Trait, such as the elements affected or the exact Contact effect, when you cast the enchantment; these effects should be based on existing Personal Traits, with the GM having final say on what's possible.
> 
>   Any *FP*{: .spirit-color } costs associated with the Trait cost *double FP*{: .spirit-color }; however, you can substitute that with whatever *FP*{: .spirit-color } you spent casting the enchantment, for as long as the enchantment lasts.  
>   As an added bonus, any action taken or checks made to initiate the Trait (such as starting to fly or transforming with Mimicry) use the action and *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check of the enchantment instead. Trying to take these actions after being enchanted requires the target roll as normal, though.

> > 
> 
> - *Curses*{: .header-font }  
  Similarly, *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can be used to temporarily neutralise the target's qualities and other Personal Traits.  
  Make a *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check and choose a quality the target has (e.g. a Personal Trait, a Status delivered by their attack, or an elemental affinity of their attack); if you succeed, the target suffers a Curse as if it was a Status, temporarily neutralising their ability to use that quality in some fashion. They can recover as normal, such as with [Items]({{ "/inventory#items" | absolute_url }}) or [*Steady*{: .courage-color }]({{ "/skills_in_detail#steady---resisting-effects" | absolute_url }}), and players can make a *Steady*{: .courage-color } check to resist as a reaction, just like any other Status.  
  The Curse lasts for 1 turn for each *Magic*{: .spirit-color } die you used.  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   - The Curse lasts for one more turn.
>   - The Curse includes another quality.
>   - The Curse affects one more valid target.

> - *Technique Spells*{: .header-font }  
  *Magic*{: .spirit-color } can even be used to improvise Techniques on the fly! Instead of making any Technique checks, you make one *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check to conjure up an effect; as long as you succeed, this Technique begins with 1 Grade of Success in any of its Primary or Secondary checks, and an effective *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } of 0.  
  For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one:
>   - Add *3 FP*{: .spirit-color } to the final Technique's effective cost.
>   - Add a Grade of Success to the outcome of the Technique's Primary and/or Secondary Checks.
> 
>   You can select up to your successes in positive Traits, as long as the *FP cost*{: .spirit-color } for the combined Traits doesn't exceed the effective cost.  
> 
>   Finally, you can add *Indirect*{: .positive-color }, *Ranged*{: .positive-color } and/or *Harmless*{: .negative-color } as bonus Traits for no additional cost; this is simply the nature of *Magic*{: .spirit-color }.  
> 
>   You don't pay the effective cost, or make any further checks – the Technique simply resolves with whatever Traits and Grades of Success you chose to give it based on your *Magic*{: .spirit-color } check. Since it doesn't make its own check, you can't benefit from its results on top of your own check (such as for Exceptional Results).
