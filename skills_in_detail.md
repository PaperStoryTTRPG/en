Typically, Skills have simple applications, and the outcome of any one check will depend on the Techniques used or the situation it's made in.

Sometimes though it's useful to have hard-and-fast rules for more complicated effects. The Skills suggested here should be considered the default, though depending on the situation, other Skills may be appropriate.

## *Aim - Item Attacks*{: .heart-color }

Usually, using consumable Items is fairly straightforward; you take an action to use an Item's effect, and no check is required.  
However, if you put in some extra effort, you can get a little more out of your Items.  
Make an *Aim*{: .heart-color } check (or other appropriate Skill) alongside your Item action.  
Each Grade of Success earns a point you can spend on any of the following bonus effects; however, be warned that any result lower than Great has a risk of backfiring as you throw caution to the wind. It's up to the GM exactly what that risk looks like or how likely it is.

- 1: This action is safe, and suffers no risk of backfiring. Has no effect on *Great*{: .great-color } or higher results.
- 1: The Item adds ¼ of its damage onto its total damage; the Item must deal damage in order to choose this effect.
- 1: Increase the Status Level of one of this Item's Statuses by 1.
- 1: Increase the duration of one of this Item's Statuses by 1 turn.
- 2: Add an appropriate Status onto this Item's effect, starting at Status Level 1 and lasting for 3 turns.
- 2: The Item isn't consumed during this action; it either remains useable or is in some fashion recoverable, but you may have to wait for a spare moment to retrieve it.

## *Athletics - Fleeing*{: .heart-color }

Sometimes you need to get away from a fight – but it's never easy.  
To make a clean getaway, you need a Grade of Success for each combatant trying to stay on your tail or otherwise keeping you in the fight. Regardless, you always need at least a *Great*{: .great-color } result.  
Keep in mind that just getting away from a turn-based battle doesn't mean you're in the clear – you might just be turning a fight scene into a chase scene!

## *Coordination - Swapping*{: .heart-color }

In battle, you sometimes want – or need – to swap places with an ally. This action doesn't require any checks, but if both players make a *Coordination*{: .heart-color } check with at least a *Great*{: .great-color } result, this becomes a free action!

## *Guard - Reducing Damage*{: .heart-color }

In battle, you can use *Guard*{: .heart-color } to reduce damage from incoming attacks. Either on your turn (as an action) or at the end of the round (as a reaction, in response to incoming attacks), make a *Guard*{: .heart-color } check.

If you choose to *Block*{: .heart-color }, you can't *Dodge*{: .spirit-color } incoming attacks in the same round, unless an [Item](TODO:LINK) or other effect would allow it.

- *Blocking*{: .header-font }  
    For each Grade of Success, you can ignore 1 point of damage this turn.  
    You can choose which attacks have their damage reduced at-will.  
    If you *Guarded*{: .heart-color } as an action, you also receive +1 Defense for each Grade of Success until next round.  
    If you reduce an attack's damage to 0 by blocking, and no Weaknesses apply, you can't suffer any Status effects from it, which might otherwise apply if you're simply tanking it with Defense.  
    Bear in mind though that the effects of your Weaknesses still apply, even if you reduced the initial damage to 0.

{: .example-callout}
> *Example: Blocking*{: .header-font }
>
> A Bob-Omb is attacked by a Fire Bro's fireball, dealing 2 damage, and a Paragoomba's dive, dealing 1 damage.  
> The Bob-Omb reacts by blocking, and gets a *Good*{: .good-color } result, allowing them to block 2 points of damage.  
> The Bob-Omb can block the Fire Bro's initial attack completely, but they still have a Weakness to Fire, so they have to take an extra +2 damage from their Weakness, and then 1 damage from the Paragoomba.

> *Blocking helps protect you from all manner of attacks – even if they would pierce through your Defense. Keep in mind though that you get one Guard check to resist **all**{: .underlined } attacks for the round – the more pressure you're under, the harder it'll be to shrug off the damage!* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)
> {: .icon-right }

- *Superguard*{: .header-font }  
    If you've reduced an attack's damage to 0 in any way (such as by blocking or through your Defense), blocking it with one more point of damage reduction allows you to make a Superguard against that attack.  
    Superguards are more potent blocks, allowing you to completely ignore all damage and Statuses from the attack and even ignore your own Weakness!  
    Better still, you can interrupt your attacker by dealing damage, stopping them from making more attacks. If the attacker struck you in melee, you interrupt any more attacks they would have made and deal 1 Piercing damage back at them. And if they attacked at range, you can reflect the full attack's damage back at them!

{: .example-callout}
> *Example: Superguard*{: .header-font }
>
> A Koopa is attacked by a Goomba's leaping headbonk, dealing 1 damage, and a Clubba's melee attack, dealing 3 damage.  
> The Koopa has 1 Defense, and blocks as a reaction with a *Good*{: .good-color } result; in between their Defense and their *Guard*{: .heart-color } result they could block all damage, but they have a Weakness to Aerial attacks. The Goomba could flip them over and completely expose them to the Clubba's attack!  
> Instead, the Koopa Superguards the Goomba's attack with one Grade of Success, interrupting it and letting them ignore their Weakness. Then they can keep their Defense and block the Clubba's attack, reducing damage to 1.

## *Heal - Recovery*{: .heart-color }

Recovering in Paper Story is generally very simple; most of the time, getting some rest is enough to fully restore *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color } and recover from [Status](TODO:LINK) effects.  
However, if you need to recover in the field, or want to use a healing Item more effectively, you can make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check.

- *First Aid*{: .header-font }  
    As an action, make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check; each Grade of Success restores *2 HP*{: .heart-color } to the target and/or reduces a Status' duration by 1 turn.  
    However, First Aid is only really useful as an initial response – each time you perform First Aid on a target, the required Grades of Success increase by 1 until they get some rest.  
    If you *fail*{: .italic } a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check like this, you instead cause them to lose HP equal to ½ your Power. Or worse, if you fail spectacularly.

{: .example-callout}
> *Example: Recovery*{: .header-font }
>
> After a tough fight, a Dayzee's ally is injured and still suffering from a poison for 4 more turns.  
> The Dayzee makes a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check to administer First Aid, with a *Good*{: .spirit-color } result.  
> They're able to restore *4 HP*{: .heart-color } and reduce the poison to 2 turns.  
> In the time it takes to perform First Aid, their ally suffers from another turn of poison (reducing the duration to 1 turn) – the Dayzee makes another *Heal*{: .heart-color } check, but only gets a *Nice*{: .nice-color } result. Because they've already administered First Aid once, this isn't enough, and they end up hurting their ally instead.

- *Administering Medicine*{: .header-font }  
    When using an Item to restore a target's *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color }, you can make a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check alongside your Item action; each Grade of Success adds a quarter of the *HP*{: .heart-color }/*FP*{: .spirit-color } restoring properties of the Item to the target. This includes all healing applications, including healing over time like Slow Shrooms or Gradual Syrups, but the Item has to already restore *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color } respectively.  
    If you *fail*{: .italic } a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check like this, you just waste the Item; if you fail spectacularly there might be worse consequences, too.

{: .example-callout}
> *Example: Medicinal Aid*{: .header-font }
>
> In the middle of a tough battle, a Boo wizard is seriously injured and low on energy. Their Squeek ally pulls out a Honey Mushroom for them, which would heal *5 HP*{: .heart-color } and *5 FP*{: .spirit-color }.  
> They use the Honey Mushroom on their Boo ally, and try to boost it with a *Heal*{: .heart-color } check, earning a *Good*{: .good-color } result. For each Grade of Success, they add ¼ of 5 to *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, which rounded down would be 1.  
> So for 3 Grades of Success, they add *+3 HP*{: .heart-color } and *+3 FP*{: .spirit-color }, for a total of *8 HP*{: .heart-color } and *8 FP*{: .spirit-color }.

{: .tip-callout }
> *It's difficult to find the time in battle to heal. Usually it's better to prevent damage by focusing on your attacks, and to worry about healing afterwards; but if you neglect your health, you'll be sure to regret it further down the line* ![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)
