Adventures and battles can take place in a wide variety of locations, under any number of conditions. Some of the common varieties are listed here, but this list and the effects attributed to each Terrain are by no means exhaustive.

Usually, all parties in battle are impacted by the Terrain, but it's possible through circumstance or Techniques for just a small area to be impacted.  
In this case, whenever characters affected would move or swap spaces under their own power, they can choose to move the Terrain instead, even moving it out of their group entirely â€“ in which case it's no longer involved in the battle.

Multiple Terrains may even be considered active at once in the same area, as long as they don't contradict each other; for instance, the weather in an area can't be both a Gale and a Heatwave.

Just like Status Effects, Terrain can appear in a variety of different levels. If the level of a Terrain isn't specified, assume it's at Terrain Level 1.  
Replace references to [X] in Terrain effects with the Terrain Level.

Finally, note that if both a Pro and a Con of a Terrain would apply in a given situation, the Con takes priority.

> ## Dark
>
> *Lighting*{: .fs-5 }
>
> Characters with appropriate *Notice*{: .spirit-color } specialisations (e.g. Dark Places, Scent) ignore the dark's effects on their skill checks.
>
> Characters can negate the effects of darkness on themselves (and on attacks targeting them) by keeping a light source close at hand, though the darker it gets, the stronger a light they'll need. Strong enough light can negate the effects of darkness entirely, effectively dismissing the Terrain.

> You're positioned somewhere comfortably above the battle, just out of reach. This is typically higher up than standard Elevation or Flying will get you, with more space to stand and cover yourself.

> Characters are able to climb up with *Athletics*{: .heart-color } as an action, as long as their surroundings would allow it and they achieve at least [X] Grades of Success.

> Otherwise, characters may only be able to reach with appropriate Techniques, or by using their surroundings wisely.
