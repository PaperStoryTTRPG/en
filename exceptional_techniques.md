# Exceptional Techniques
{: .no_toc }

While Techniques start out simple, [Exceptional Results]({{ "/grades_of_success#exceptional-results" | absolute_url }}) are rewarded here too.

When your Primary or Secondary Check rolls high enough, instead of earning *SP*{: .courage-color }, you can take some of that *SP*{: .courage-color } and spend it on the following options at-will.  
Critically, you can make Exceptional Techniques even when you wouldn't be able to recover *SP*{: .courage-color } (such as after a Second Wind) â€“ all that matters is if your check is good enough to qualify.

## Primary Checks

- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Add +1 DMG to one of this Technique's Strikes.
- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Increase *both*{: .underlined } the duration and Status Level of one of this Technique's existing Statuses by 1 each.
- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains or loses an instance of one of the following Traits, if it would be appropriate to do so:  
    - *Aerial*{: .positive-color }
	- *Burst*{: .positive-color }
    - *Element*{: .positive-color }
    - *Homing*{: .positive-color }
    - *Indirect*{: .positive-color }
	- *Launch*{: .positive-color }
    - *Ranged*{: .positive-color }
    - *Reach*{: .positive-color }
    - *Selective*{: .positive-color }
	- *Strike-Through*{: .positive-color }
	- *Throw*{: .positive-color }
	- *Delayed*{: .negative-color }
	- *Cooldown*{: .negative-color }
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique inflicts a new Status on the enemy with no check required, lasting 1 turn at Status Level 1.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains or loses an instance of one of the following Traits, if it would be appropriate to do so:  
	- *Sequential*{: .positive-color }
    - *Blowback*{: .negative-color }
    - *Penalty*{: .negative-color }
    - *Side-Effect*{: .negative-color }
- *3 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains or loses an instance of one of the following Traits, if it would be appropriate to do so:  
    - *All*{: .positive-color }
    - *Overrun*{: .positive-color }
    - *Piercing*{: .positive-color }
    - *Exhausting*{: .negative-color }
- *5 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains or loses an instance of one of the following Traits, if it would be appropriate to do so:
    - *Group*{: .positive-color }

## Secondary Checks

- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Increase *both*{: .underlined } the duration or Status Level of one of this Technique's existing Statuses by 1.
- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: If this Technique would restore *HP*{: .heart-color } or *FP*{: .spirit-color }, it restores an additional +1 to all targets.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique restores either *+1 HP*{: .heart-color } or *+1 FP*{: .spirit-color } to all targets.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: Choose a Status; this Technique dismisses that Status from all targets. For the purposes of this effect, different types of *Boost*{: .positive-color } and *Weaken*{: .negative-color } count as different Statuses.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique inflicts (or bestows) its targets with another Status with no check required, lasting 1 turn at Status Level 1.

> A Goomba attacks with an *Excellent*{: .excellent-color } headbonk against a mighty dragon!  
> Ordinarily, they'd land two Strikes for 1 DMG each, but they decide to use some of the *5 SP*{: .courage-color } they'd normally gain to pump it up a little.  
> They choose to deal more damage across their strikes, paying *3 SP*{: .courage-color } to boost damage by +3.  
> Then, they inflict a light Stun for *2 SP*{: .courage-color }.  
> The end result is a headbonk that deals 2 DMG, then 3 DMG, and Stuns the enemy for 1 turn at Status Level 1.
