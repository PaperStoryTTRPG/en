# Exceptional Techniques

While Techniques start out simple, [Exceptional Results](TODO:LINK) are rewarded here too.

When your Primary or Secondary Check rolls high enough, instead of earning *SP*{: .courage-color }, you can take some of that *SP*{: .courage-color } and spend it on the following options at-will.  
Critically, you can make Exceptional Techniques even when you wouldn't be able to recover *SP*{: .courage-color } (such as after a Second Wind) â€“ all that matters is if your check is good enough to qualify.

## Primary Checks

- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Add +1 DMG to one of this Technique's Strikes.
- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Increase the duration and Status Level of one of this Technique's existing Statuses by 1 each.
- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains one of the following traits, if appropriate:  
    - Aerial
    - Element
    - Homing
    - Indirect
    - Ranged
    - Reach
    - Selective
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique inflicts a new Status on the enemy with no check required, lasting 1 turn at Status Level 1.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains one of the following traits, if appropriate:  
    - Launch
    - Piercing
    - Sequential
    - Throw
- *4 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique gains one of the following traits, if appropriate:
    - All
    - Group

## Secondary Checks

- *1 SP*{: .courage-color }: Increase the duration or Status Level of one of this Technique's existing Statuses by 1.
- *2 SP*{: .courage-color }: This Technique adds on another Status with no check required, lasting 1 turn at Status Level 1.

> A Goomba attacks with an *Excellent*{: .excellent-color } headbonk against a mighty dragon!  
> Ordinarily, they'd land two Strikes for 1 DMG each, but they decide to use some of the *5 SP*{: .courage-color } they'd normally gain to pump it up a little.  
> They choose to deal more damage across their strikes, paying *3 SP*{: .courage-color } to boost damage by +3.  
> Then, they inflict a light Stun for *2 SP*{: .courage-color }.  
> The end result is a headbonk that deals 2 DMG, then 3 DMG, and Stuns the enemy for 1 turn at Status Level 1.
