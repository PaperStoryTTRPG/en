The number of Successes needed for any action is reduced to a shorthand, representing how impressive your actions are. These are referred to as Grades of Success, or just Grades *(You may sometimes see them abbreviated as GoS in the community)*{: .fs-3 }, and vary based on your overall Successes.

- *0 Successes:*{: .header-font } Nothing; unless the action can work automatically, it fails.
- *1 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Nice! 1 Grade of Success.*{: .nice-color }
- *2 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Good! 2 Grades of Success.*{: .good-color }
- *4 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Great! 3 Grades of Success.*{: .great-color }
- *6 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Wonderful! 4 Grades of Success.*{: .wonderful-color }
- *8 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Excellent! 5 Grades of Success.*{: .excellent-color }
- *10 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Unbelievable! 6 Grades of Success.*{: .unbelievable-color }

Any additional Grades of Success beyond *Unbelievable*{: .unbelievable-color } require 2 more Successes at a time.

As a general rule, *Nice*{: .nice-color } or *Good*{: .good-color } results are still generally successful, but may suffer other complications, such as taking longer than you'd like or forcing you to make a difficult choice.

*Great*{: .great-color } results are successes with no unforeseen drawbacks. In most circumstances, a *Great*{: .great-color } result is your target.

And *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } or greater results are often exceptional, possibly exceeding your expectations.

If needed, you can pull your punches – treating your result as a lower Grade than your earned. 

## Opposed Checks

In the event of an opposed check, success is determined by comparing all competing players' rolls. The winner of the check is the player with the most Successes. 

In the event of a tie, compare the relevant Stat for each tied player and the highest Stat wins. And if that's still a tie, then either the defender wins, or nothing happens at all, at the GM's option.

## Exceptional Results

High rolls are always worthwhile, as the Stars bestow their blessing on exceptional individuals. Even if you chose to take a lower result, you gerate *SP*{: .courage-color } based on the total Grades of Success you rolled.  

This *SP*{: .courage-color } can be added to your pool immediately, or spent immediately to fuel [*Exceptional Techniques*{: .courage-color .underlined }]({{ "/exceptional_techniques" | absolute_url }}).

Be mindful though that if you spend any *SP*{: .courage-color } during the check – such as to [Try Again]({{ "/star_power#try-again" | absolute_url }}) – you can't generate any *SP*{: .courage-color } for your result.

Otherwise, as long as your rolled dice for your check, and your action is successful:
- *Great*{: .great-color } results generate *1 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } results generate *2 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Excellent*{: .excellent-color } results generate *5 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Unbelievable*{: .unbelievable-color } results generate a whopping *10 SP*{: .courage-color }!
