The number of Successes needed for any action is reduced to a shorthand, representing how impressive your actions are. These are referred to as Grades of Success, or just Grades, and vary based on your overall Successes.

- *0 Successes:*{: .header-font } Nothing; unless the action can work automatically, it fails.
- *1 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Nice! 1 Grade of Success.*{: .nice-color }
- *2 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Good! 2 Grades of Success.*{: .good-color }
- *4 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Great! 3 Grades of Success.*{: .great-color }
- *6 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Wonderful! 4 Grades of Success.*{: .wonderful-color }
- *8 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Excellent! 5 Grades of Success.*{: .excellent-color }
- *10 Successes:*{: .header-font } *Unbelievable! 6 Grades of Success.*{: .unbelievable-color }

Any additional Grades of Success beyond *Unbelievable*{: .unbelievable-color } require 2 more Successes at a time.

As a general rule, *Nice*{: .nice-color } or *Good*{: .good-color } results are still generally successful, but may suffer other complications, such as taking longer than you'd like or forcing you to make a difficult choice.

*Great*{: .great-color } results are successes with no unforeseen drawbacks. In most circumstances, a *Great*{: .great-color } result is your target.

And *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } or greater results are often exceptional, possibly exceeding your expectations.

## Opposed Checks

In the event of an opposed check, success is determined by comparing all competing players' rolls. The winner of the check is the player with the most Successes. 

In the event of a tie, compare the relevant Stat for each tied player and the highest Stat wins. And if that's still a tie, then either the defender wins, or nothing happens at all, at the GM's option.

## Exceptional Results

High rolls are always worthwhile, as the Stars bestow their blessing on exceptional individuals. As long as your check succeeds, you receive *SP*{: .courage-color } based on the total Grades of Success you rolled. As long as you rolled dice for your check, and it's otherwise successful:
- *Great*{: .great-color } results earn *1 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Wonderful*{: .wonderful-color } results earn *2 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Excellent*{: .excellent-color } results earn *5 SP*{: .courage-color }!
- *Unbelievable*{: .unbielevable-color } results earn a whopping *10 SP*{: .courage-color }!

Be mindful though that if you spend, earn or restore any *SP*{: .courage-color } during the check, you can't earn any more *SP*{: .courage-color } in the process!

In any case Techniques can still spend that *SP*{: .courage-color } on *Exceptional Technique*{: .courage-color .underlined } results, even if you can't otherwise add the *SP*{: .courage-color } earned to your pool.
