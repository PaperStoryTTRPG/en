They can't be targeted if the carrier is in the way, and likewise, the carrier can't be targeted by attacks if their passenger would block them.</p> <p>If an attack would affect both characters at the same time (e.g. Group, Quake), it hits them as normal.</p> </blockquote> <p class="center-img"><img src="assets/images/scenes/15.png" alt=""></p> <blockquote class="tip-callout"> <p class="icon-right"><em>The combination of Adapted and Carrier can be a huge help to allies in a sticky situation.
