# Species
{: .no_toc }

While all the peoples of the Mushroom Kingdom are wildly different, their advantages are roughly alike. Every Species looks something like this:

## Species Name

![](assets/images/icons/tipguy.png)
{: .float-right-desktop }
A description of the Species and how they fit into the world. These descriptions are simple and general, and do not define individual members of their Species.

### Stat Modifiers
### Base Power & Defense

### Pros

The Skill Specialisations and other Traits that make denizens of that Species more capable.  
&emsp;&emsp;*Some Traits, like Immune, will be described in more detail like this.*{: .fs-3 }

### Cons

The Traits that a character of that Species have to deal with that are generally less desirable.  
&emsp;&emsp;*Some Traits, like Weakness, will be described in more detail like this.*{: .fs-3 }

### Other Traits

Any other qualities the species has that may not fit neatly into a Pro or a Con go here in one large block underneath Pros and Cons.

Most often this is for Species with a State Trait, which grants them contextual bonuses/penalties.

### Tech Defaults

Sets of Technique Traits a character of that Species can include when they start designing a Technique, without affecting its cost.

Multiple instances of a Trait are listed as "Trait x2", "Trait x3", and so on.

Each Technique can only benefit from one set of Tech Defaults without affecting its cost at a time.

Each set of Tech Defaults is set apart by colour and by line.Each Trait in a set is set apart by commas.

Example Tech 1  
*Example Tech 2, 2nd part of Tech 2*{: .alt-grey-line }  
Example Tech 3

Any *Required*{: .underlined } or *Optional*{: .underlined } effects are listed underneath, and can (or must) be taken in addition to Tech Defaults.

### Example Techniques

An example of a Technique a character of this Species might use, assuming they have 1 Power and not accounting for their level limit on negative Traits.

Includes potential outcomes and skills required for Primary and Secondary checks.

Some of the more commonly adventurous folk of the Mushroom Kingdom are listed here; it is however far from all the available options, as the Mushroom Kingdom and its surrounds are huge and incredibly diverse.

For some of the rarer Species, or those less inclined to adventure – from Toads to Chomps to Piantas – refer to the [Species Compendium](TODO:LINK).
