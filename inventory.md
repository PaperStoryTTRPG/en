Players can carry around a wide variety of Items, Power-Ups, Gear and Badges.  
Regardless of the size or number of things being carried, all players begin play with 10 Inventory slots, which can each fit an Item, Power-Up, piece of Gear or similarly-sized handheld object.

## Items

Items are single-use consumables with a wide variety of effects. Generally, Items require an action to use and are consumed immediately. You don't need to make any special checks, though you can get more out of your Items using [*Aim*{: .heart-color }](TODO:LINK), [*Heal*{: .heart-color }](TODO:LINK) and [*Crafts*{: .spirit-color }](TODO:LINK).
