# Level Up!
{: .no_toc }

When you win a fight or achieve something else notable, you receive Experience Points (traditionally known as ![](assets/images/icons/starpoint.png){: .inline-icon } Star Points).

Your GM may choose to roll dice to decide on your reward, calculate it in some way, or allocate levels based on your overall achievements – but in any case, you're rewarded for your effort, with more difficult challenges earning more Experience Points.  
As a general rule, overcoming anything noteworthy may earn you about 5-20 Experience Points, and truly gruelling challenges like boss fights around 20-40.

Whenever you receive 100 or more Experience Points, you immediately level up!

When you level up, take away 100 Experience Points; you immediately recover all *HP*{: .heart-color } and *FP*{: .spirit-color }, and you receive the following:
- +1 to a Stat
- +1 to a Skill relating to that Stat (e.g. *Heart*{: .heart-color } and *Coordination*{: .heart-color })
- Either +1 to a *different*{: .underlined } Skill relating to that Stat, or a Skill Specialisation for *any*{: .underlined } Skill
- The option to tweak one of your existing Innate Techniques; you can add a positive trait, add a negative trait, remove a positive trait and/or remove a negative trait.  
If your GM agrees you can make more drastic changes, but you should always try to keep the spirit of the original Technique.
- At every 5th level, the ability to learn a new Technique, and increase your Power by +1!

Each level represents an exponential increase in your character's abilities. A Level 5 hero stands head and shoulders above a Level 1 rookie!

Paper Story plays best at lower levels, with a recommended cap of 4 Innate Techniques – in line with the original games.  
Though of course, that's just a suggestion. Higher power games might run up to level 20 or beyond, with massive HP totals and truly exceptional dicepools. Do whatever works best for your game!
