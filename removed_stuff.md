Techniques -> Technique Traits

While the mechanics of building a Technique can be complicated, it's best to work within this system until you have a good idea of how Techniques work and what effects should cost.

If you find that you just can't make the Technique of your dreams, or your Technique isn't as effective as it should be, try discussing alternatives with your GM. You should consider this system to be a starting point for your own exciting ideas!

Removed from Terrain Technique Trait:

If the target is able to change position (e.g. by [*Swapping*{: .heart-color }]({{ "/skills_in_detail#coordination---swapping" | absolute_url }})), the Terrain stays in the same place, and may affect different targets.
