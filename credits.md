# Credit Where Credit Is Due

Paper Story owes its existence to the following people:

- Nintendo & Intelligent Systems for creating these games in the first places. Please support the original developers.  
Paper Mario, in all its forms, is © Nintendo.  
Paper Mario, Mario and all related properties are a trademark of Nintendo. Nintendo does not sponsor, authorise or endorse Paper Story.  
**This is just a fangame.** I cannot stress that enough.

- Artistic and design credits for individual sections as provided.

- [LadyLuck](https://ladyluck.itch.io/) for their amazing Paper Mario asset packs, which Paper Story both borrows from and leans on heavily. Credits are provided wherever possible but their work deserves special mention.

- [HammerBro101](https://www.deviantart.com/hammerbro101) for their work on the font *Mario Font v3 Solid*{: .header-font } which Paper Story borrows for its headers.

- All of the *Wonderful*{: .heart-color } *@Players*{: .heart-color } playing along and providing great feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AUQJmKH5pf). Special mention to:
    - *@lucydndprincess*{: .heart-color }, *@bigmeatyflaws*{: .heart-color } and *@meineeds.rest*{: .heart-color } *(Editor's note: That's me!)*{: .fs-3 } for all their contributions, including moderation, Lucy and Flaws' exhaustive homebrew content, Meï's extraordinary work on the wiki *(this very website)*{: .fs-3 } and generally being extremely supportive.
    - *@afanguy*{: .heart-color } for their incredible work on the Avrae dice bot we use to represent the nudge system.
    - *@RT1337*{: .courage-color } and *@tact.elive*{: .courage-color } for playing along in the early days when all we had was a single play-by-post, which helped immensely and inspired me to keep this up.
    - *@TheMemorySlot*{: .heart-color } (Matthew Schuff) and *@Sprited*{: .heart-color } (Zack Whoolery) for their hard work and dedication on the [Paper Story: Deluxe Edition](https://thememoryslot.itch.io/paper-story-dx) fork! It's a very cool project and I'm super excited to see how it comes together.


- Emily, Matt and Trent, for supporting (and putting up with) this silly little passion of mine.

- Matilda, who I can't wait to share this world with.

Always remember, Paper Story is a free product and 100% open source for you, the fans, to enjoy.
