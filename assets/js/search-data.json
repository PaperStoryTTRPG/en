A character's Species modifies their Stats, adds extra Skill Specialisations, and provides many other traits. For more options, consider looking at the Species Compendium! . 2. Get Your Stats At level 1, you begin play with a 1 in Heart, Spirit and Courage, plus the advantages of your Species. Then, you can choose one of those stats to receive another +1 boost, representing your character's unique personal qualities. 3. Assign your Skills All Skills fall under the umbrella of one Stat – for example, Athletics is a Heart Skill, while Notice is a Spirit Skill. During character creation, your Stats receive varying Skill Points and Skill Specialisations to further customise your character. - a. Choose one Stat's Skills to receive +4 Skill Points and +2 Skill Specialisations. - b. Then, choose a second Stat's Skills to receive +3 Skill Points and +1 Skill Specialisation. - c. Finally, the remaining Stat's Skills receive +2 Skill Points and +1 Skill Specialisation. It's okay if your character concept isn't fully formed to begin with! As you ready on you might find some interesting content that you want to work in, or during play you might pick up a Badge you hadn't considered working with. The joy of roleplay is finding new directions to take your character! . 4. Define your Skill Specialisations While Skills are broad general capabilities for your character, Specialisations are the specific things they excel in. Your Specialisations are up to you to define. You can even assign Specialisations to Skills you otherwise don't have any points in! But as a general rule, they shouldn't be so vague that they always apply, or so specific that they rarely make a difference. 5. Design your Techniques Your Techniques are the special moves that help your character excel in combat. Usually these are straightforward attacks, but you can customise them to be as complex as you wish. You begin play with two Innate Techniques. It's recommended that you keep at least one Technique that costs 0 FP, so that you always have a basic attack option and can make First Strikes. 6. Fill up your pockets Finally, you start with 100 Coins (or more or less, depending on your campaign) to spend on Items, Power-Ups, Gear and Badges. Items, Power-Ups and Gear of all sizes occupy one of your 10 inventory slots, while Badges are small enough to not take up space – but the Badges you can actually equip and use at the same time will be restricted by your BP. Don't stress too much about getting the right Items or Badges right out of the gate – you might find it easier to just jump in with nothing but the clothes on your back and the Coins in your pocket. You can always go shopping once you know what you're dealing with – or make do with what you can find! . ",

    "content": ". | Initiative and the Surprise Round | First Strikes | Free Actions and Reactions | Targeting | Damage and Knockouts | . Combat in Paper Story is largely abstract; allied characters act as a single group, arranging themselves in a front-to-back formation at the start of combat (either arranged as they wish, or dictated based on circumstance). Typically combats are between two groups, players and enemies. If players are fighting it out or enemies are split between factions, though, it can get more complicated and require more groups. During each round of combat each player has a turn, during which they can take one action. Turns proceed through the group one-by-one, going from front to back. At the end of the players' turns, each enemy group takes their actions in sequence, until there are no more enemies and the next round of combat begins. ",

    "title": "Initiative and the Surprise Round",
    "content": "Before most combats, all players have to roll Initiative to see how quickly they react – in other words, who gets a First Strike. Typically this check depends on Athletics, but Trickery, Notice or other checks may be more appropriate, depending on how the fight begins. Importantly, not every fight demands you check for Initiative or the Surprise Round! It all depends on how the narrative flow leads into battle; if you're standing face-to-face with the enemy long enough to have some banter, no matter how quickly you move you probably won't get the drop on them. If you're proceeding with Initiative, you'll need to decide who moves first. Players usually fight as one group, but if they're divided up at all, the order they act in is decided by which group has the most Grades of Success in total. If any player groups are tied, then it's the GM's call. In any case, enemies never move ahead of the players. Your Initiative determines how soon you can defend yourself, and how well you can coordinate your actions with your allies. With a Good result, a player can act in the Surprise Round to deliver a First Strike on behalf of their group! Each extra Grade of Success allows them to partner up with one other ally during the Surprise Round, as long as that ally also rolled well enough to act alongside them. Who moves first exactly is a tactical decision for you and your allies to make; if you really can't decide, it's usually better for the highest results to move first. Example: Striking in Tandem . A quick-witted Paratroopa gets the drop on their enemies, moving with Wonderful speed! They're followed by two Yoshi twins with a Great result each, and their Cleft guardian brings up the rear with a Good result. While each party member moved quickly enough to score a First Strike, they can't all go at the same time. The Paratroopa can attack with up to two allies, but the Yoshi's can only pair up with one other ally, and the Cleft can't pair up with anyone at all. So the Paratroopa could attack with one of the Yoshi's, or the Yoshi's could attack together, or the Cleft could attack on their own. On the other hand if a player fails their Initiative check, one of the enemies can make a First Strike against them instead! No matter how many people fail their Initiative checks, the same enemy can't make multiple attacks in the Surprise Round. Example: Getting Ambushed . A Thwomp, a Whomp and a Boo are set on upon by a deadly Chomp! . The Thwomp and the Whomp both fail their Initiative checks, scoring no Grades of Success. The Boo fares a bit better with a Nice result. Both the Thwomp and the Whomp failed, but the Chomp can only make one First Strike. If there were two Chomps they could each make a First Strike against the Thwomp and the Whomp. If there was a third Chomp, though, they'd still only get two First Strikes, since the Boo isn't vulnerable to attack yet. The Surprise Round is a sudden burst of action, so it isn't counted as a full round. While players can take action and have a chance to react to damage, this isn't considered a \"turn\" in the traditional sense. So Statuses and other durations aren't affected by the Surprise Round.

If however a target is Flying or otherwise out of reach, they can't be targeted in melee and will generally require Ranged, Reach or Aerial Techniques. The good news is they're not able to block you off from other targets. The same general rules apply to players – if you want to protect your teammates, you usually want to be standing in front of them, but it becomes harder to stop ranged or airborne attackers.

If your turn would have passed by the time you get revived, you can take your turn immediately after revival. Otherwise, you need a decent rest before you can get back up – or at least a 10 minute power nap. Typically these rests fully restore HP and FP.

    "content": "Now if we put it all together, we can present an example of how a session works in Paper Story. For this example we'll be following the adventures of a group of three – Kelly the Koopa, Buster the Bob-Omb and Squinch the Squeek. GM: Okay gang, when we last left off you were lost in the wild jungle of Keelhaul Key. The sun is starting to set and your rations are just about gone. Any bright ideas? . SQUINCH: I remember I tried sniffing out the shore last time… that didn't work out. BUSTER: If we follow the sun we'll eventually reach the shore, right? . GM: That would work, but the jungle is very thick. You'd need some way to blitz through the underbrush. KELLY: Well my claws are pretty sharp, can't I just hack through? . GM: That would work, it'd be a messy job though. It sounds like an Athletics check to me. KELLY: Can I add my specialisation in Brute Force? . GM: Yeah, I can see that working, go for it. The rest of the team sit back and wait to see how Kelly handles things. Kelly rolls 2d6 for her Athletics, plus 1d6 for her Brute Force specialisation. She rolls a 5, a 3 and a 2; one Grade of Success. KELLY: Okay that's a Nice… I have three Heart, so I'll nudge my 3 into a 4 for another Success… I can nudge the 2 into a 4 as well but that would still only be Good, right? . GM: Yeah, Good is good though. So Kelly starts ripping and tearing, and pretty quickly you've established a path. She's making quite a bit of noise in the process. KELLY: Woo! . BUSTER: That noise is probably going to attract some trouble, though. Do we notice anything? . GM: Kelly's a little too into it to hear much of anything right now, but yeah, maybe you guys should make a Notice check . Buster and Squinch make their checks. Squinch includes his specialisation in Scent – normally he'd ask the GM, like Kelly did, but they've been doing this for a while and he pretty much always follows his nose. It's easier in this case for the GM to say when he can't use it instead. BUSTER: I've got a 4, and two 5's… If I nudge a 5 up to a 6 I can roll one more, that's a 2… I've got 2 Spirit left though so I can just nudge that up to a 4. All together that's 4 Successes, Great! . SQUINCH: 5 Successes for me, so Great too. GM: Very nice. Buster, you can hear something rustling around in the jungle that's not coming from Kelly's work… sounds like it's behind you. Squinch, you can smell the putrid too-ripe scent of poison plants. SQUINCH: Piranha Plants, maybe? . BUSTER: I'll quietly get Kelly's attention, we need some muscle. SQUINCH: I'm going to go ahead and hide myself if that's okay, I have a Stealth specialisation. GM: Yeah, we'll count that for your Initiative. A trio of slithering Putrid Piranhas burst out from the bushes behind you! Buster and Kelly I'll need Athletics from you, Squinch you can use your Trickery. The GM adds three small figurines to the table to represent the enemies. While the team rolls their Initiative checks, the GM looks over his notes on Putrid Piranhas. KELLY: Easy, I've got 2 for a… Good! Right? . SQUINCH: Yeah that's right. I've got 4, so Great! . BUSTER: Uhh, this isn't good. No successes from me. KELLY: It's okay! We'll get the drop on these guys. It'd be either me or Squinch who can attack now, right? . GM: Yep, you can attack on your own. Squinch could technically attack with an ally, but you'd need to have rolled a Great as well. KELLY: Ah, nuts. Well I don't know what these guys can do, do you want to take point? . SQUINCH: Sure, I'll lead off with my Sneak Attack. Squinch chekcs his notes for Sneak Attack. It has Piercing, Strong and Unwieldy, so it deals 2 DMG on a Nice result, and 4 DMG on a Good result. If the plants had Defense, he'd be able to bypass that with Piercing, too. Since he already rolled a Great on his Initiative, that result carries forwards to his Sneak Attack. SQUINCH: Alright, well my Initiative was Great, so… 4 damage. GM: That's a respectable hit, the plant reels in shock! However his buddy sees an opportunity to bite down, hard, on Buster! . BUSTER: Oh jeez, I'm really not the athletic type huh? I'll just try to block it with a Guard check I guess… 1, so just Nice. Plus my 1 Defense. The GM checks his notes, and sees that he's given Putrid Piranha's a 3 DMG attack with a three-turn Lingering (3) poison. If Buster suffers this poison he'll take another 3 damage at the end of the turn – but he knows Buster has a chance to respond. GM: Not quite enough, sorry Buster. You're able to deflect the bulk of it but you still take 1 damage, and its vile breath afflicts you with a Lingering poison! . BUSTER: I do have Steady at least, so I'm going to try and reduce it… wait, hold on, I'm a Bob-Omb. Aren't I immune to poison? . GM: Yeah sorry, you're right. Alright, that's First Strikes over, who's moving first? . KELLY: I'm the muscle here! I'll get in front. I dunno if it'll make much of a difference though if the plants can burrow past me. I'm not too distracted to go first, right? . GM: No you're fine, Buster got your attention before things got too heated. BUSTER: Do you still have that Power Punch, Squinch? . SQUINCH: Oh yeah! I'll go after Kelly then so I can use it on Buster. BUSTER: Great! I'll bring up the rear. Hopefully I can get a big enough boom to end the fight quickly. The players arrange their own figurines in a row on the table, and the GM moves the three Putrid Piranha figurines in front of them. GM: Okay then, Kelly to act. KELLY: Rip and tear! I'm going to claw that front guy with my Savage Slicer! . Kelly moves her figurine up in front of the enemy while she rolls to act out an attack – this isn't really necessary, but it helps her visualise the action. Savage Slicer is Kelly's strongest attack, costing 4 FP, which Kelly marks off her sheet before she rolls. The Technique has Indirect (representing Kelly's scaly armoured claws), Strong x2, Weaken (Defense) x2, Commitment (Primary) and Unwieldy. Adding it all together with Kelly's 1 Power, this gives her a Technique with 3 Power, that requires a Good Coordination check to deal damage, and can shake up enemy defenses with a secondary Bully check. Kelly's chosen to split the damage into two 3 DMG strikes, for 6 in total. KELLY: Oh yeah! That's Good! . The GM quickly checks his notes again and confirms the Putrid Piranhas have 8 HP; including the damage Squinch already dealt, Kelly's attack will easily finish off the first enemy. KELLY: Okay so, for the Bully check – . GM: No that's okay Kelly, you've torn through him just fine. With two mighty claw sweeps you scatter the plant's leaves to ribbon, and it slumps onto the ground, defeated. KELLY: Oh, okay. Woo! . The GM takes the figurine for the defeated plant off the table. GM: Squinch to act. SQUINCH: So Kelly obviously wasn't listening, but that's okay, we'll just go ahead with our plan. KELLY: Oh, sorry guys. Fights get me so heated! . BUSTER: Haha, we get it, you're fine. And now we know they've got something like 10 HP, and I can save some FP on my turn. SQUINCH: Yeah it's all good, we appreciate your moxie. So anyway, I'm going to hand Buster my Power Punch and boost him up. GM: Did you want to make a Heal check to improve that at all? . SQUINCH: On no dice? No I'll give that a miss, thanks. GM: Okay, that's fine. So you hand it off to Buster and he's able to chug it down, then suddenly doubles in size. Buster, your move. BUSTER: Fee, fi, fo, fum… Heh heh, I think the basic Boombast should do it here. Boombast is Buster's basic explosive attack, with Scaling, Indirect, Element (Blast), Variant (Athletics), Burst, Strong and Exhausting, Unwieldy. Because most of the FP cost is covered by his Bob-Omb Tech Defaults, he's able to reduce it down to 0 FP, but can't act during the next turn. The end result is an explosive attack that can hit both plants, dealing 2 DMG with a Nice, 4 DMG and a Solid Hit with a Good and +2 Raw Damage with each additional Grade of Success. BUSTER: Come on, Athletics… No! That's only Nice. So 2 DMG, darn. I can't boost it up with SP if we've just started! . SQUINCH: +2 Attack though, right? From the Punch. BUSTER: Oh right, yeah. It's not a Solid Hit so it's just 4 DMG. GM: Okay, the super-sized Buster explodes, but unfortunately he detonates a little early! The edge of the blast deals 4 DMG to the front plant, and burts a little further for 3 DMG to its ally. Moving on, they're covered in soot and badly shaken up, but these Piranhas are still aggressive and can see that Buster hasn't got another attack in him. So while the front one lashes out at Kelly in melee, the other burrows under and pops out behind her, chomping down on Buster! That's 3 damage to both of you – plus the poison, for Kelly. KELLY: I've got Defense, so I'll Guard. That's a Great! So it goes down to 2 from my Defense, then I reduce it twice, so I won't take any poison. And I have an extra Grade of Success… Oh! I can Superguard, right? . GM: Yep, you're able to defend and pirouette into a shell strike. Their fangs bounce off your tough shell and they recoil in pain! You deal 1 more damage to the Putrid Piranha, and it recoils in pain! . KELLY: Hm, so somewhere between 6 and 10 HP… Well, whatever, I'll take 'em out next turn! . BUSTER: Yeah, that's super. I Guarded as well, but got nothing. I have some Defense too, right? . GM: Yep. So your metal hide is a bit tougher than they're used to, and you can't be poisoned, but the Piranha's vicious bite still crunches down with force to deal 2 damage. They're still raring to go. Next round, it's Kelly from the top, what do you do? . And that's the basics of play in Paper Story! . Now you're ready to get out there and explore the world yourself! The rest of the book goes into a lot more detail on specific skills and Items you might need to know about, but if you're eager to start, you can jump right into a game and look it up as you go! . ",

    "title": "The Stats",
    "content": "Characters in Paper Story all follow the same general rules. They all have three Stats, and a variety of Skills that fall under the umbrella of those stats. Heart – your Health Points and physical ability. Characters have 5 HP x their Heart – to a minimum of 1 HP. Spirit – your Flower Points and mental/technical ability. Characters have 5 FP x their Spirit. Courage – your Badge Points and spiritual/social ability. Characters have 3 BP x their Courage. In addition, players have some special statistics used for combat, which are separate from your Stats and Skills. Power – your raw combat skill and capacity for dealing damage to foes. The base damage for your Techniques is determined by your Power. You begin play with 1 Power, unless your Species modifies it. Attack – how hard you can hit in the heat of the moment. Under most circumstances, your Attack is 0, but it can temporarily go up or down. Every one of your Strikes are modified by your Attack. Defense – whenever you're struck in combat, you reduce the damage by your Defense. You get your full Defense against all strikes made against you, even if they're made by the same attacker. For most species, your beginning Defense is 0, though this can be improved with Gear. Before we go any further, there's just a few more general rules to cover off: . | Players generally have one \"action\" per turn, representing something they want to do with the time they have. Usually this warrants a skill check (and thus, rolling dice). When there's no time pressure (such as outside of battle), these actions can be resolved in any order. | If something is measured in \"turns\", outside of battle, treat 1 turn as being about a minute. | If a number is divided in any way, unless otherwise specified, round the remainder down to the nearest whole number – to a minimum of 1. Be careful, sometimes this will go down to 0! Usually when it would give an unfair advantage for ½ of 1 to wind up the same as ½ of 2. In these cases though the minimum is specified. | . Things get a little more complicated in battle, but the following core rules are at the heart of everything in Paper Story! . ",

    "title": "Rolling and Nudging Dice",
    "content": "Paper Story uses the Nudge System, a lightweight form of conflict resolution where you roll a pool of dice, then try to nudge the results into your favour. For every Skill point and relevant Specialisation you have on any given check, you can roll an additional six-sided die (1d6). Non-player characters (NPC's) don't have Stats, Skills or Specialisations, and they don't roll at all. The spotlight is always on the players. No matter what, your success and failure hinges on your own actions. When you make a check you're using your Skill, and the Stat it falls under, to try and make something happen, which prompts a dice roll. Each time you roll your dice, you're hoping to roll 4 or more; the Target Number. When a die shows a number equal to or greater than that, it counts as a Success. And if you roll a 6, you can add another d6 to your pool and roll it, too! . Your Stats make you more consistent, allowing you to nudge the results into your favour. For every point you have in the appropriate Stat, you can modify a die result by 1. If this turns it into a 6, you can roll another d6, just the same as if you'd rolled it naturally. Example: Standard Checks . A Koopa with 3 Heart and 2 Coordination tries to hammer a Goomba, making an attack roll. He rolls two dice (2d6) for his Coordination, and rolls 4 and 1. 4 is a successful result, so this counts as 1 Success – a Nice result! He can then spend his 3 points in Heart to increase the 1 to a 4, making 2 Successes. (A Good result!) . Be warned, though – if at any point more than ½ of your dice are 1's, you suffer a Critical Failure! You lose all your Successes, and your action may fail spectacularly. Example: Critical Failure . A Bob-Omb with 2 Heart and 2 Guard attempts to block a spinning shell attack from an enemy Koopa. He rolls two dice (2d6) for his Guard, and rolls 4 and 1. 4 is a successful result, so this counts as 1 Success – a Nice result, able to block the damage. They nudge the 4 into a 6 for another roll. The new d6 comes up 1; and now more than half their dice are 1's! It's a Critical Failure. They got greedy! The Bob-Omb takes the damage full-force, and the GM decides this failure causes the Koopa to spin around them, Disorienting them for the next turn! . ",

    "content": "Due to situational penalties or a lack of skill you might find yourself rolling at 0 dice – or less. In these cases you can't use your Stats at all! . Anything less than 1 die is rolled as 1d6, with negative numbers subtracting from the number of Successes. Example: Rolling without Dice . A Boo with 1 Courage and 0 Persuade tries to talk his way out of a dire situation. He rolls one die (1d6), with a result of 3 – he can't fix that up with his Courage, so he has no Successes! . ",

    "content": "So what do you do when your skills fall short? You turn to your teammates! . When you take an action to assist someone else's check, you take ½ the dice you would have for the action (rounded down, to a minimum of 0) and add them to the other character's dicepool. Then, they can use your Stat points as well as their own to nudge the dice in their favour. You have to have at least 1d6 yourself to assist! Otherwise your help isn't useful enough to provide any advantage. Example: Working together . A Koopa, a Bandit and a Dayzee try to lift a heavy stone statue to inspect what's underneath, using Athletics. The Koopa volunteers to lead the job; they have 3 Heart and 3 Athletics. The Bandit has 2 Heart and 2 Athletics, and the Dayzee has just 1 Heart and 1 Athletics. The Koopa can roll 3d6 from their own Athletics, and +1d6 from the Bandit – they don't get any dice from the Dayzee, because their Athletics is too low. The four dice come up 2, 2, 3 and 3. Fortunately, pooling together everyone's Heart, the group has 6 Heart to spend, enough to boost everything to 4 for a Great result! . ",

    "title": "Power-Ups",
    "content": "Power-Ups are particularly special kinds of consumable Items which provide ongoing effects for a single willing target, similar to Statuses caused by Booster Items. A character can have one Power-Up active at a time, with new Power-Ups replacing existing Power-Ups immediately. Power-Ups provide a variety of passive benefits, and can grant modifiers to Innate Techniques or give the user access to entirely new Techniques. These Technique benefits can't be used simultaneously; you can't enhance your Techniques with more than one Power-Up effect at a time, for instance. The magic of a Power-Up doesn't last long! It takes special care to preserve them for future use, requiring a Crafts, Magic or similar check to keep them safe. Typically this requires at least a Great result, though as always, you may be able to get by with less. Otherwise if they aren't used, a Power-Up will wilt or expire within a few minutes of acquiring it. Some of their magic will last, though, allowing them to be used as ordinary Items. When purchased in stores, Power-Ups come pre-preserved in special containers – accounting for their higher cost. Once a Power-Up is used, its Power-Up state lasts as long as its user is able to concentrate, typically ending on its own outside of combat or during breaks between adventure. Whenever the user takes damage from an attack or is otherwise shaken up, they have to make a Steady check to hold on; on failure, the Power-Up is lost. Each Steady check made requires a higher Grade of Success than the last check, until the Power-Up is lost. No matter what, the effects of the Power-Up don't impact this Steady check, either to make it easier or harder. Fire Flower . Power-Up • 50 Coins . Bestows the power to generate fire.

Grants the user +1d6 to checks where their bouncy form provides a clear advantage, such as Athletics checks to bounce around, or Guard checks to deflect attacks. However, checks where the user's weightlessness is an hindrance, such as holding their ground with Steady, require a higher Grade of Success than usual. Boomerang Flower . Power-Up • 50 Coins . Gives the target the ability to generate boomerangs from thin air. When wilted, the head of the flower can be thrown similarly to a Dusty Boomerang. For 0 FP: Boomer-Whack A quick smack with a held boomerang, hitting the target indirectly. Coordination: Auto: [Power] DMG Nice!: [2x Power] DMG For 5 FP: Boomerang A hefty spinning boomerang smack from afar. Hits all targets in a straight line, twice. Aim: Good!: : [Power + 1] DMG x2 . Super Bell . Power-Up • 50 Coins . Gives the target a fluffy outer coat, making them look and behave more cat-like. When the magic fades, the bell can be rung loudly, producing a similar effect to a Dizzy Dial, but based on sound. For 2 FP: Adds Aerial, Piercing or Indirect to an unarmed melee attack. For 0 FP: Cat Claws A rapid duo of claw swipes, striking indirectly with the suit's sharp claws at the foe's weak point. Coordination: Auto: [Power] Piercing DMG Nice!: [Power] Piercing DMG x2 Grants the user +1d6 to checks where their cat-like nature provides a clear advantage, such as Athletics when jumping and climbing, or Steady when balancing. Rock Mushroom . Power-Up • 50 Coins . Coats the target in a light-weight rocky shell and allows them to bend the earth to their will. When wilted, the mushroom can be thrown to the ground for a similar effect to a POW Block. For 5 FP: Adds +1 Attack, Indirect and Element (Earth) to an attack. For 5 FP: Rolling Rock Forms a boulder around the user, then bowls through enemies – hitting indirectly. The user can bowl over the target to strike targets behind them. Each new target slows them down, dealing 1 less damage (to a minimum of 1). The sheer force of the blow can leave each target reeling. Athletics: Good!: [2 x (Power + 1)] Earth DMG Athletics or Bully: Nice!: Disorient (1) for 3 turns Good!: Disorient (2) for 3 turns Great!: Disorient (3) for 3 turns Adds: +1 Defense +1 Resist (Shock) Weakness (Blast, Quake) Your stone form is chipped, nullifying this Power-Up's Defense and Resist boosts for a turn for each point of damage taken (minimum 1 turn), as well as Dazing (1) you for the same duration. Removes: Immunities and Resistances to Blast and Quake Hover Fly . Mini Mushroom . Power-Up • 30 Coins . Causes the user to shrink to miniscule proportions. When wilted, can be thrown at enemies to produce a similar effect to a Mini Mr. Mini. For 5 FP: The user becomes Hustled (1) for 1 turn.

Trickery: Nice!: Become Secure of 1 turn Adds: -2 Attack Homing and Selective to all Techniques Weakness (Air, Crushing) Crushing attacks can't bypass your Secure status from Under-Foot. The Level and Duration of all Statuses you suffer from these attacks are doubled. Grants the user +2d6 to checks where their small size provides them a clear advantage, such as landing a hit with Coordination, or dodging attacks with Trickery. However, checks where the user's size is a hindrance, such as Guard, require a higher Grade of Success than usual. Mega Mushroom . Power-Up • 200 Coins . Artist: @ladyluck . Causes the user to grow to a tremendous size. When wilted, can be consumed for an effect similar to a Power Punch. For 5 FP: Megaton Charge The user barrels forwards with their full weight, striking all enemies in the target group. Athletics: Good!: [Power] DMG Great!: [2x Power] DMG For 5 FP: Megaton Stomp The user slams the ground with their full weight, causing a powerful shockwave – affecting all enemies outside the user's group in contact with the floor, wall or ceiling. Athletics: Great!: [2x Power] Piercing Earth Quake DMG Adds: +3 Power Grants the user +2d6 to checks where their large size provides them a clear advantage, such as blocking attacks with Guard, or standing their ground with Steady. Checks where the user's size is a hindrance, such as Coordination, require two more Grades of Success than usual; in the case of this Power-Up's Megaton Charge and Megaton Stomp, this is already factored in. Power-Ups don't need to be preserved – if you don't want to use one right away, letting it wilt so you can use it as an Item can be a solid strategy. After all, the original games didn't have any Power-Ups! . ",

If players request personalised Gear, Craft it themselves or (in the case of Basic Gear) begin play with a Tool Technique, they can even design their own! . No matter the type of Gear, any ammunition they required isn't tracked; if any Gear is represented by a large number of disposable equipment (such as throwing weapons), one piece of Gear is enough to represent an entire supply. Basic Gear . • Costs 30 Coins . | Doesn't provide bonuses to stats or checks. | If the Gear was generated through a Tool Technique in character creation, players can begin play with it without spending Coins, and don't design another Technique for the Gear; unfamiliar users only have access to a basic version of that Technique, using the below rules at the GM's discretion. | Otherwise, this Gear provides the user with a new Technique. This Technique must cost 0 FP, and can include one Trait as a Tech Default, based on the Gear's primary use (e.g. Tool for weapons, or Aerial for boots). Regardless of the user's level, only 1 Trait can be used to reduce the Technique's FP cost. | Personal Traits can be added for a cost of 10 Coins each, but checks using those Traits (e.g. Fly) can only score up to a Nice result, the Trait can't cost FP and their numerical values (e.g. Resist, HP healed with Immune, Contact damage) are limited to 1. | . Super Gear . • Costs 400 Coins . | Grants either +1 Power (when wielded as a Weapon), +1 Defense (when carried as a Shield or worn as Armour), or +1 to a Stat (but typically doesn't affect HP, FP or BP). | Adds +1d6 to appropriate checks. | Grants the user a new Technique using the Gear. This Technique can include one Trait as a Tech Default, based on the Gear's primary use (e.g. Tool for weapons, or Aerial for boots). Regardless of the user's level, only 3 Traits can be used to reduce the Technique's FP cost. | Personal Traits can be added for a cost of 25 Coins each, with their numerical values (e.g. Resist, HP healed with Immune, Contact damage) beginning at 1. Checks using those Traits can score up to a Great result, but no higher. Each numerical effect of a Trait can be enhanced to 2 for another 25 Coins, but no further. | . Ultra Gear . • Costs 800 Coins . | Grants either +2 Power (when wielded as a Weapon), +2 Defense (when carried as a Shield or worn as Armour), or +2 to a Stat (but typically doesn't affect HP, FP or BP). | Adds +2d6 to appropriate checks. | Grants the user two new Techniques using the Gear. These Techniques can include one Trait as a Tech Default, based on the Gear's primary use (e.g. Tool for weapons, or Aerial for boots). Regardless of the user's level, only 6 Traits can be used to reduce the Technique's FP cost. | Personal Traits can be added for a further 50 Coins each, with their numerical values values (e.g. Resist, HP healed with Immune, Contact damage) beginning at 1. Each numerical effect of a Trait can be increased, 1 point at a time, for another 50 Coins. | .

A good piece of Gear can either supplement your existing skillset or make you more reliable in different fields, giving you more options to work with. ",

You can equip any number of Badges, but their BP total must be equal to or less than your maximum BP. Badges enhance your abilities in a variety of ways, often subverting the rules of standard checks and Techniques, providing Badge Techniques or unlocking entirely new abilities. It's important to remember though that Badges only add onto a character's standard actions; whenever a Badge would add traits to a Technique, they can only be added to an Innate or Gear Technique. No matter what, the effect of any Badge can only be added once for each copy of that Badge equipped; you couldn't pay Power Smash's FP cost twice, unless you had two copies of Power Smash equipped.

If you want to talk about or play Paper Story, feel free to join us on the Discord! https://discord.gg/AUQJmKH5pf . If you prefer scrolling on the web to flicking through a book, Paper Story has its very own wiki! https://paperstoryttrpg.github.io/en/ (Yes you are already on it. Welcome!) . And if you stumbled onto this game and don't know where to look for more information, you can always find it in its home at Itch. https://joy-games.itch.io/paper-story . For those of you new to roleplaying, TTRPG's are known as either tabletop or table-talk roleplaying games. They have common roots with their digital cousins, but are quite a bit different where it counts. Basically, one player acts as Game Master – equal parts referee and storyteller, this player controls the entire world of NPC's and oversees its rules. All the other players are responsible for their own characters and their actions. Completely responsible. The only real constraints you have are what seems reasonable to your game and the people you play with. As you might expect, these games are a lot more flexible by nature. You have the opportunity to literally play a role, and it's generally expected that you make choices that are consistent with the role of your character – even if they're not strictly speaking what a 'good' player would do. There are many more write-ups that go into deeper detail than this with respect to the big-name RPG's – Dungeons and Dragons, World of Darkness, Savage Worlds, to name a few. If that generally sounds like a lot of fun, I'd highly recommend you look into some of those games, and of course have fun with Paper Story! . ",

A character's Personal Traits are all their special qualities which are passively active, with a wide variety of effects.

Typically this applies to the stronger Trait, or in the case of a negative Trait like Weakness, the more troublesome Weakness.

With a Great result from both characters, this becomes a free action. During either character's turn, they can split back up as a free action, with the carried character taking up a space adjacent to the carrier. If the carrier is Dazed, Stunned or KO'd, both characters split up immediately. While a character is being carried they move with the carrier, occupy the same space in combat and take their turn after the carrier. They can't be targeted if the carrier is in the way, and likewise, the carrier can't be targeted by attacks if their passenger would block them. If an attack would affect both characters at the same time (e.g. Group, Quake), it hits them as normal. The combination of Adapted and Carrier can be a huge help to allies in a sticky situation.

    "title": "Clone",
    "content": "You are able to split your mind and body into two or more like-minded individuals. While your Items and Badges don't get copied, you can divide them as you see fit whenever you split up. With an action and a successful Steady check, you can either split up into two perfect copies or merge two nearby clones back together. With a Great result this becomes a free action! Otherwise, all parties involved lose an action for the turn. When you first split apart, the number of Grades you earn becomes your Copy Level. The Copy Level can fluctuate from there, either dropping by 1 (when one of you splits up again), or increasing by 1 (when a pair of clones merges back together). While split apart, each copy is weaker than the sum of its parts; both you and your copies have your max HP and max FP capped at no more than ½ your maximum, plus the Copy Level – or your ordinary maximum, whichever's lower. Whenever two copies recombine, pool together the remaining HP and FP of both copies, up to the limit of the new form's maximum. Example: Fuzzy Splits . A Fuzzy with 15 HP splits apart, with a Good result for a Copy Level of 2 – giving them a maximum of 7 + 2 for 9 HP. Later the clone takes 5 damage, going down to 4/9 HP. When re-combining, the Fuzzy goes back to having 15 HP at maximum. Since their combined HP total would have been 9 + 4 for 13 HP, the Fuzzy is brought back to 13/15 HP! . While split up you can make actions as normal, but your clones don't roll for their actions; they instead automatically receive a number of Grades of Success equal to their dicepool, or the Copy Level (whichever's lower). Since they don't roll, they can't benefit from Exceptional Results at all. Example: Many Hands Make Light Work . While split in two, a Fuzzy and their clone attack in tandem! Their normal attack plan is to repeatedly bounce on the enemy with 3 Athletics. The original Fuzzy can roll and make their attack as normal. The Copy Level is only 2, though – so while the clone would get a Great result with 3 Grades of Success, it's limited to 2 Grades for a Good attack. It's difficult to divide your consciousness up like this; whenever your or one of your clones are seriously startled, or one of you takes more damage than you Copy Level, you must make a Steady check. The exact difficulty depends on the situation, with damaging attacks starting at 1 Grade for each point of damage taken beyond the Copy Level. If you fail, the Copy Level drops by 1; if the Copy Level is reduced to 0 this way, you lose control! . When you lose control of your copies you're left completely Stunned (6) for the next turn! Meanwhile, your clones are free to act however they please. Most of the time your clones will take the opportunity to recombine or run away, but they might take more troublesome actions, too… . Cloning yourself as much as you dare is a great way to get a lot of extra actions; just make sure you don't get in over your head. ",

A transformed character can revert back to their own form at any point during their turn as a free action, requiring no check. This transformation is a complete physical transformation with an added affect on the user's psyche, allowing them to act just like their target! Effectively they have all the Traits, Innate Techniques and other physical qualities of their new form – even their Skill Specialisations! . While transformed, you lose your own Techniques and Traits, but you retain your own Inventory, Stats, Skills, Power and Skill Specialisations. Any Gear or Badges obtained as part of your transformation can be equipped at-will as a free action. Example: Anything You Can Do . A high level Duplighost spies a Goomba in the field, and transforms into their exact double! . The GM has to do some quick thinking. While the enemy Goomba usually headbonks for just 1 damage, the GM decides to treat it as a two-hitting Technique with 1 Power; the enemy Goomba isn't especially skilled, so there's room for improvement. The Duplighost can use their 3 Power with this Technique, seriously souping it up! The attack now deals 3 damage, and strikes twice with an additional Grade of Success. They don't have any Athletics dice themselves, but the GM rules that this new form comes with an Athletics specialisation in jumping – giving them 1d6 to try their new headbonk! . Transformations become harder and more expensive to maintain the less familiar you are with the intended form, though skilled shapeshifters can offset the cost with higher results. For each Grade of Success achieved beyond the requirements, you can pay 1 less FP per turn. If this would reduce the FP Cost to less than 0, this transformation becomes a free action! . If you can't see the target or otherwise follow a visual reference, Mimicry checks require an additional Grade of Success. | Nice!: A ordinary creature that you're familiar with, such as an allied Goomba. Costs 1 FP per turn. | Good!: An ordinary or familiar creature, such as an enemy Goomba or an allied Chomp. Costs 2 FP per turn. | Great!: An unusual or large target, such as a Piranha Plant, Chomp, or Hothead. Costs 3 FP per turn. | Wonderful!: An ordinary or familiar creature, with copies of their Gear (including Gear Techniques) and Badges. Costs 4 FP per turn. | Excellent!: An extremely unusual or large target, such as a dragon or giant Blooper. You might not even have seen it before – it might not even exist! Includes copies of their Gear, Gear Techniques and Badges, if applicable. Costs 5 FP per turn. | . Naturally, these transformations are difficult and very unstable; if you lose focus while transformed (such as by taking damage), you must make a Steady check, requiring the same Grade of Success as if you were transforming into your current form. On failure, you revert forms on the spot. Mimicry is an incredibly powerful Trait. Even investing in it a little bit will allow you to transform into your enemies and allies, expanding your options in and out of battle.

At the end of the round, if any attacks are made that target you, you can react with either a Guard or a Dodge check. For each Grade of Success, you can reduce the Raw Damage you would take this round (after applying Defense and Resist) by 1 point. If you're being targeted by multiple strikes, you can assign this damage reduction to any of them as you see fit. By Guarding you can even ignore an attack's Status effects! When you reduce an attack's damage to 0 (or less), and you don't have any Weaknesses to consider, you can ignore its Status effects. Otherwise you may have to resist them with Steady, even if your Defense nullified the damage. If you have a relevant Weakness, its effects are applied after you finish Guarding – even if you reduced the damage to 0. Example: Guarding Weaknesses . A Piranha Plant is attacked by a Fire Bro's fireball, dealing 2 damage, and a Paragoomba's dive, dealing 1 damage. The Piranha Plant reacts by Guarding, and gets a Good result, allowing them to block 2 points of damage. The Piranha Plant can block the Fire Bro's initial attack completely, but they still have a Weakness to Fire. They have to take an extra +2 damage from their Weakness, and then 1 damage from the Paragoomba. With exceptional Guarding, though, you can turn the tables with a Superguard! . If your Guarding would reduce a strike's damage below 0, it triggers a Superguard instead. Superguards completely ignore all damage, Statuses and other effects from attack. They even ignore your own Weaknesses! If the attacker struck you in melee, you interrupt their attack and deal 1 Piercing damage back at them. And if they attacked at range, you can reflect the strike's Raw Damage back at them! . Example: Superguard . A Koopa is attacked by a Goomba's leaping headbonk (dealing 1 damage) and a Clubba's swing (dealing 3 damage). The Koopa has 1 Defense, and Guards as a reaction with a Good result; in between their innate Defense and their Guard result they could theoretically block all the damage, but they have a Weakness to Aerial attacks – they would still be flipped by the Goomba's headbonk, which would nullify their Defense against the Clubba's attack. Instead, the Koopa Superguards the Goomba's attack, using their Defense and one Grade of Success to reduce the damage below 0. This way they can stay standing, giving them 1 Defense and 1 Grade from their Guard result against the Clubba's attack. Blocking helps protect you from all manner of attacks – even if they would pierce through your Defense. Keep in mind though that you get one Guard check to resist all attacks for the round – the more pressure you're under, the harder it'll be to shrug off the damage! . ",

But if you're under pressure and need to patch someone up right away, you can always try some First Aid. As an action, make a Heal check; each Grade of Success restores 2 HP to the target and/or reduces a Status' duration by 1 turn. If this would restore a KO'd target back to full health, they're revived on the spot! . First Aid is only really useful as an initial response, so it gets a little harder each time you try; each time you carry out First Aid on a target, the required Grades of Success increase by 1. This penalty lasts until the target gets some proper rest. If your First Aid attempt fails, you instead cause them to lose 1 HP for each Grade you failed by. Or potentially even worse, if you fail spectacularly… . Example: Recovery . After a tough fight, a Dayzee's ally is injured and still suffering from a poison for 4 more turns. The Dayzee makes a Heal check to administer First Aid, with a Good result. They're able to restore 4 HP and reduce the poison to 2 turns. In the time it takes to perform First Aid, their ally suffers from another turn of poison (reducing the duration to 1 turn) – the Dayzee makes another Heal check, but only gets a Nice result.

    "content": "Crafts (and other appropriate Skills) can be used to develop useable products from raw materials, which may otherwise be useless. First, choose an Item, Power-Up, Badge or Gear you want to make and have the materials for. A Nice result is enough to make something with an equivalent value of 5 Coins; for each Grade of Success earned, you can double the value range of the Items you can make, as follows: . | Nice!: 5 Coins | Good!: 10 Coins | Great!: 20 Coins | Wonderful!: 40 Coins | Excellent!: 80 Coins | Unbelievable!: 160 Coins | . Failure consumes all materials involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes. Example: Crafting Gear . A Koopa smithy wants to smith a Super Hammer. Super Gear costs a whopping 400 Coins, so this is a tall order, but it's well worth the effort. They earn a Wonderful result, for an equivalent of 40 Coins; an impressive outcome but only a tenth of the way there. They try to push themselves to keep working, and earn a Great result on the second check; this only adds on 10 Coins, for a total of 50. They decide to set the project aside before they make a Mistake, but take pride that their new Gear is 1/8 complete. Once you've created something or otherwise know how it's made, it becomes easier to craft, with value starting from 10 Coins on a Nice result. In any case, one attempt to Craft can only produce one Item, Gear or Power-Up at a time, and can't produce enhanced or mixed Items. Depending on the quality of the materials you use, you may be able to craft Items with less Grades of Success than normal; however, appropriate materials must always be sourced and used up. As a general rule, when it comes to materials: . | Items can be made with common materials which can be sourced on the cheap in most settlements, costing no more than half the Item's value. | Badges and Gear require more valuable and rarer materials, which may take more work to find on the market, or require the crafter to seek them out in the field. | Power-Ups require some form of magical charge, either taken from rare materials, or crafted with Magic assistance (as a Skill Substitution or Skill Enhancement; if you have an ally assisting, you don't necessarily have to do the magic yourself). | . If you don't achieve a high enough result, you can either settle for a similar product you could have made with the materials you used instead (such as settling for a Mushroom over a Super Mushroom), accept failure and make a Mistake, or take the time to make another check; each additional check made in this way takes more time, and successive checks without rest require a higher Grade of Success.

For each Grade of Success, you can choose one of the following effects to apply to the new Item: . | Consume another Item, adding all of its effects (HP, FP, gradual recovery, damage, Status, etc.) to the new Item, using the first Item's targets. No matter what, you can't combine more than two Items at once. | Increase an existing HP and/or FP recovery effect by 2. | Increase the Item's damage by 1 (if it would deal damage). | Add an Element or replace an existing Element, changing the type of damage dealt. | Add a Status, or increase an existing Status Level by 1. New Statuses have the same duration as the original Item's Statuses (if applicable), lasting up to a minimum of 1 turn. | Increase the duration of all the Item's Statuses and other effects by 1 turn. | . Failure instead consumes all Items involved and produces a Mistake; a useless Item that may provide only a severely restricted form of the intended effect, or something much worse. Critical Failure is bound to create even worse Mistakes. Cooking can be a costly exercise, but well worth it! Stronger attacks, better healing, and simply condensing multiple Items into one Inventory slot are all good reasons to top up when you're in town. Once you've created an Item or otherwise know its recipe, it becomes easier to make it again, requiring half as many Grades of Success (to a minimum of Nice). However, you have to use the same method when following a recipe – a chef sweetening an Ice Storm to make an Icicle Pop is very different to an alchemist strengthening it to make a Blizzard Storm, for instance. Treat the new Item's Coin value as equivalent to ½ of its component Items' values, +5 more Coins for each Grade of Success required to make it (not accounting for the halved Grades of a known recipe). Including a previously enhanced or mixed Item in your crafting adds one more Grade of Success to the recipe's difficulty for each time an ingredient was previously enhanced or mixed, as it becomes a more volatile ingredient. Example: Mixing Items . A Dayzee wants to combine some delicious Honey Syrup with their own special recipe, a Fried Sparkshroom (combining a Super Shroom and a Volt Shroom). They make a Crafts roll, and earn a Good result. Since the Fried Sparkshroom was previously mixed together, they need one more Grade of Success to go ahead with this recipe. They have just enough Grades to finish off the recipe, slathering the mushroom to make a Glazed Sparkshroom, which restores 10 HP, 5 FP and bestows the same Contact Trait as a Volt Shroom. If they wanted to sell this invention, it would have an equivalent value of 27 Coins (15 from the Fried Sparkshroom, 2 from the Honey Syrup and 10 from their Good result). Just be careful you don't take things too far. You wouldn't want that powerful Superbombomb you've been working on to backfire once you take it into the field, would you? . ",

For each target, you learn information depending on the total Grades of Success assigned, as well as any information you could have with less Grades. No matter how many targets you Tattle on, if you only allocate Great results or better you can treat this as a free action! . | Nice!: You know general information about things similar to the target, but not the target specifically. You can at best determine a couple fun facts and their current and maximum HP, and can easily track their current HP going forwards. | Good!: You know a little about the specific target, including some of their main methods of attack, their Defense and any general danger they may pose. | Great!: You know specialised information about the target, including their Immunities, Resistances or Weaknesses, and usually some juicy gossip. | Wonderful!: You know just about all that you could reasonably determine about the target, including all of their attacks, common strategies and equipment available to them – or that you might be able to take from them! | Excellent!: You can glean all sorts of useful information about the target, including the sortes of details only an expert could know! | . Keep in mind that if the information you're seeking is particularly rare, involved or unusual, it might need an expert's insight to glean anything useful. Knowhow specialisations are particularly useful for this. Tattling isn't just for combat! A knowledgeable character with a dedicated field of study can be an invaluable asset over the course of an adventure. Whether you're finding shortcuts or solving mysteries, it's always worth taking a moment to study! . ",

    "title": "Magic - Spontaneous Spells",
    "content": "Magic's most powerful quality is its versatility – the ability to do anything! . These rules apply whenever you would cast a spell that's not already a key part of your repertoire, like a Technique, representing the challenging art of spontaneous casting. Whatever kind of spell you cast, you choose beforehand how much of your Magic dicepool and Spirit dicepool to \"unlock\"; this includes dice you receive from your Skill and your relevant Specialisations. Note though that you don't have to pay or unlock situational or temporary bonuses, like the aid you'd get from someone's assistance, a Boost Status, Magic-boosting Gear or the extra Spirit you get from a Spirit Plus Badge. | To unlock up to 1 of your Magic dice and up to 2 of your Spirit points, pay 3 FP at a time. | . | If you have a relevant Specialisation, you pay 2 FP at a time instead. | . | . | If you have a relevant Efficient trait, you only pay 1 FP at a time instead. | . | If this spell would be restricted by one or more Devotion traits, you pay twice as much FP overall. | No matter the circumstances, you always pay at least as much FP as one d6 or point of Spirit would cost. | . Then just like a normal check, roll your dicepoll, and nudge it along with your unlocked Spirit. Keep in mind that no matter what, Magic spells can't be used to gain or bestow FP or SP (besides the SP you'd generate from an Exceptional Results. A master magician always plays to their strengths! With enough magical power, you're limited only by your creativity! . Skill Substitution . Magic can be used to emulate other skills, such as Athletics, Notice or Bully, by making a Magic check instead – completely replacing the check you'd make with your Magic pool. Since this is a magical effect it can even offset the penalties you'd normally have to endure! . Example: Substituted Skills . A Cleft witch finds themselves stranded on a river bank while their Koopa companion swims across. They have no Athletics to speak of, and their dense stone body isn't great at swimming, but they do have 3 Magic and a specialisation in Terraforming. Instead of swimming across, they conjure a stone bridge to walk across – paying 8 FP to use all four Magic at their disposable. Better still, if any of their other allies needed a ride, they could walk across the bridge too! . Skill Enhancement . When an ally makes a non-Magic check, you can enhance it with Magic. You can even enhance your own checks, if it's something you're already skilled in. This works as if simultaneously made the check with your action, and were assisted by yourself using you Magic as a free action. You pay FP to unlock you Magic and Spirit as normal, then add ½ of that dicepool (to a minimum of 0) and up to your unlocked Spirit onto the main Skill check. Example: Enhanced Skills . A Koopa sorcerer comes under attack! . While they have 2 Heart and 1 Guard, they're much better at spellcasting, with 5 Spirit and 2 Magic. They can pay 6 FP to use their two Magic dice, unlocking 4/5 Spirit; as they're assisting themselves, they add half of that onto their main Guard dicepool, for +1d6 and a total of 2d6. The dice come up 1 and 2; since they can use 2 Heart and 4/5 Spirit, this is enough to boost the dice to a 4 and a 5 for a Good result! Their tough shell is bolstered with a glyph of warding. … Just try not to run out of FP. Enchantments . Magic can be used to temporarily enchant targets with Personal Traits, such as Fly, Invisibility or Mimicry. Make a Magic check and choose a Personal Trait; if you succeed, the target receives the chosen Trait, lasting a number of turns equal to your Magic dicepool or Spirit statpool (whichever's higher). Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher. For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | The Enchantment lasts for one more turn. | The Enchantment includes another Trait. | A numerical value of one of the Traits increases by +1. | One of the Traits includes one more element (if applicable). | The Enchantment affects one more valid target. | . If the target already has a Trait they would receive from this enchantment, the enchantment temporarily overrides their Trait; this can be used to substitute existing Immunities and Resistances. You have to specify any particulars of the Trait, such as the elements affected or the exact Contact effect, when you cast the enchantment; these effects should be based on existing Personal Traits, with the GM having final say on what's possible. Any FP costs associated with the Trait cost double FP; however, you can substitute that with whatever FP you spent casting the enchantment, for as long as the enchantment lasts. As an added bonus, any action taken or checks made to initiate the Trait (such as starting to fly or transforming with Mimicry) use the action and Magic check of the enchantment instead. Trying to take these actions after being enchanted requires the target roll as normal, though. Example: Enchanting Traits . A Goomba enchanter is sneaking along behind their Boo ally; their friend is able to fly and turn invisible, and not wanting to get left behind, the Goomba decides they should too. They decide to be conservative and pay 6 FP for two of their Magic dice and their full 3 Spirit. They get a Good result, and choose to give themselves the Invisibility Trait; they also add in the Fly Trait, and make it last an extra turn, for a total of 4 turns. They immediately turn invisible and start flying. Ordinarily it would cost 2 FP to turn invisible for a turn, and 2 FP for each turn after that; but because they've already spent 6 FP, they're already covered for the first three turns! . Curses . Similarly, Magic can be used to temporarily neutralise the target's qualities and other Personal Traits. Make a Magic check and choose a quality the target has (e.g. a Personal Trait, a Status delivered by their attack, or an elemental affinity of their attack); if you succeed, the target suffers a Curse as if it was a Status, temporarily neutralising their ability to use that quality in some fashion. They can recover as normal, such as with Items or Steady, and players can make a Steady check to resist as a reaction, just like any other Status. The Curse lasts a number of turns equal to your Magic dicepool or Spirit statpool (whichever's higher). For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | The Curse lasts for one more turn. | The Curse includes another quality. | The Curse affects one more valid target. | . Example: A Curse on Ye . A Squeek wizard is beset on all sides by a storm of 4 Paratroopas – and their allies are firmly set on the ground. They attempt to bring the enemy down to earth, spending 8 FP to use their full 4 Spirit and 4 dice (from 3 Magic and a Specialisation in Curses), earning a Great result. They choose to remove the Paratroopas' ability to fly, equivalent to the Fly Trait. With their Grades of Success, they're able to ground each of their enemies for 4 turns. Curses come in many forms, but usually, they're a horrible time. There's not much you can do besides tough it out. Technique Spells . Magic can even be used to improvise Techniques on the fly! . Instead of making any Technique checks, you make one Magic check to conjure up an effect; as long as you succeed, this Technique begins with 1 Grade of Success in any of its Primary or Secondary checks, 1 Power (regardless of your own), and an effective FP cost of 0. For each Grade of Success you earn, you can choose one: . | Add 3 FP to the final Technique's effective cost. | Add a Grade of Success to the outcome of the Technique's Primary and/or Secondary Checks. | Add +1 Power. | . You can select up to your dicepool or Spirit pool (whichever's higher) in positive Traits, and the same amount again in negative Traits, as long as the FP cost for the combined Traits doesn't exceed the effective cost. As this isn't an Innate Technique, and you're not directly attacking, it works a bit differently to a normal attack. None of your own Tech Defaults are included in the Technique, you don't include your Attack modifier, and since you're not rolling the actual Technique's check you can't benefit from Exceptional Techniques. You can however add Indirect, Ranged and/or Harmless as Tech Defaults for no additional cost; this is simply the nature of Magic. You don't pay the effective cost, or make any further checks – the Technique simply resolves with the qualities you chose to give it based on your Magic check. Example: Improvised Spells . A Dayzee witch wants to cast a hex on their enemies, but doesn't have the right Techniques for the job. Instead, they improvise. They spend 8 FP to use their full 4 dice from 3 Magic with a Specialisation in Hexes, and earn a Great result. They can add up to 4 positive Traits, and up to 4 negative Traits. They want the hex to stop all their enemies in their tracks, so they add Group, Lengthen and Daze x3, giving the hex an effective cost of 8 FP. They don't need it to deal any damage though, and they're sure it will work without a hitch; so they give it the negative traits Harmless and Commitment, reducing the effective cost to just 3 FP. Finally, they take their 3 Grades of Success; 1 is spent increasing the FP pool for the Technique to 3, which is enough to pay the effective cost. The last 2 are spent to give the Technique a Great Grade of Success. The end result is a Technique that Dazes (3) their enemies for 4 turns, giving them plenty of time to act. ",

If you attempt to Dodge, you can't also Guard against attacks in the same round, unless an Item or other effect would specifically allow it. A Great result allows you to dodge one Strike. For each additional Grade of Success, you can dodge one more Strike. Just remember that not every attack can be dodged! It has to make sense in context. Whether it's homing attacks, powerful earthquakes, noxious cloud or massive gouts of flame, sometimes no matter how quickly you move you just have to face the attacks head-on. Example: Dodging . A Squeek is attacked by a pair of Hammer Bros, tossing two hammers at a time! . They can't handle their powerful hammer throws, and decide to Dodge instead. They make a Trickery check and earn a Wonderful result. They're able to completely dodge two hammer throws, but have to take the two remaining hammers head-on. You don't need to Dodge attacks if you can prevent them! Invisibility effects and Secure Techniques are great for getting around attacks, if used carefully.

    "content": "Stylish Moves are risky gambits and fancy flourishes for little to no gain – but the crowd goes wild when you nail them, and the Stars reward such great showmanship. When making a Stylish Move, once per round you can use Perform in place of your ordinary check – this can be any kind of check, as long as it doesn't normally use Perform. You can even make a Stylish Move when using Magic, though you still pay FP as normal. Nailing a Stylish Move is tricky, requiring one more Grade of Success than usual. If you succeed you add 2 SP to your pool, and double the SP you would have generated from an Exceptional Result! Since this SP is added directly to your pool, you can't spend it on Exceptional Techniques; the thrill of the spotlight must surely be its own reward! . Your effective Perform Skill is limited by your value in the Skill being substituted, including any of its relevant Specialisations. Any extra dice you'd receive for Perform, such as from your Badges, your Perform Specialisations or Boosts, are added to the pool after your Perform is limited. Example: Stylish Moves . A Dayzee with 1 Coordination and 3 Perform makes a flashy melee attack. Since their Perform is higher than their Coordination, they can only use 1 of their regular Perform dice, but can add +1d6 for their Perform Specialisation in Stylish Moves, and have access to their full 3 Courage. Ordinarily they'd need a Nice result to deal their full damage, but due to the difficulty of a Stylish Move, they need a Good result instead. They earn a Wonderful result, much more than they needed! In addition to the effects of their attack, they earn 2 SP for pulling off their Stylish Move, and double the SP they'd normally get from a Wonderful result – another 4 SP, for a total of 6. ",

    "content": "Whether you're affected by a Status or resisting some other effect, Steady allows you to grit your teeth and bear it. You can resist with Steady as a reaction whenever you receive one or more new Statuses. If you would be affected by multiple Statuses at once – such as from the same attack – then you resist them all at once. For each Grade of Success, reduce their Status Level and duration by 1. Status Level can't be reduced lower than 1, but duration can be dropped to 0, negating the status! . As an action you can attempt to remedy as many of your active Statuses as you want, affecting them all at the same time. If your Steady check manages to lower all your negative Status' durations to 0, any excess Grades of Success instead make this check into a free action. Example: Steadying Yourself . A Squeek is bitten by a particularly deadly variety of Piranha Plant, which normally afflicts its prey with Lingering (5) for 5 turns. When the Squeek is bitten, they get to make a Steady check as a reaction, and achieve a Good result – reducing it to Lingering (3) for 3 turns. At the end of the round, they take 3 damage, and the poison downgrades to Lingering (2) for 2 turns. On their turn, the Squeek tries to get the poison under control. They take an action to Steady themselves, and achieve a Great result. They're able to reduce the duration down to 0 turns and negate the Status entirely. In fact, they have a spare Grade of Success, allowing them to make this into a free action! . Don't neglect your Steady, brave warriors! It's tempting to focus on your combat skills, but Steady is the only way to avoid a lot of Statuses.

Stat Modifiers Power/Defense Modifiers . Add The Pros – and Cons – that come with this subspecies, these are added onto the existing species. If a subspecies would duplicate any traits, only one instance of that trait is kept – typically the most impactful instance (the strongest value, or the worst Weakness, for instance). This can be subjective, so check with your GM if you're not sure. This doesn't apply to anything with a + sign; if a subspecies adds +1 Defense, that means it stacks directly onto your Defense! . If an Immunity conflicts with a Weakness, with no remaining window for the Weakness to take effect, the Weakness is completely removed from the final species. Remove Everything that a creature of the existing species gives up for the subspecies. If multiple subspecies are being applied, this applies retroactively; the order you apply subspecies templates doesn't matter. If you'd lose something at any point in the process, typically, the final species can't have it.

All Techniques start from the same basic template, functioning as either a single-strike or multi-strike attack: . Basic Attack (0 FP) An ordinary single-strike melee attack. Coordination: Auto: [Power] DMG Nice!: [2 x Power] DMG (No Traits) . Basic Double Attack (0 FP) An ordinary multi-strike melee attack. Coordination: Auto: [Power] DMG Nice!: [Power] DMG x2 (No Traits) . Techniques require the user to make what's called a Primary Check in order to deal damage, which defaults to their Coordination. Other traits might add on a Secondary Check, which is rolled after a successful Primary Check. As always, better results generate better opportunities. But unlike most other checks, the threshold for an attack's Primary Check can be so simple as to work automatically – succeeding without so much as a single success! . Your traits might raise the Primary Check's floor from an automatic success up to Nice and above, like so: . Unwieldy Attack (0 FP) An unwieldy single-strike melee attack. Coordination: Nice!: [Power] DMG Good!: [2 x Power] DMG Unwieldy . Unwieldy Double Attack (0 FP) An unwieldy multi-strike melee attack. Coordination: Nice!: [Power] DMG Good!: [Power] DMG x2 Unwieldy . Bear in mind though that if a Technique doesn't earn enough Grades to achieve any result, or the Primary Check suffers a Critical Failure, it fails outright! . Example: Primary Conflict . A veteran Hammer Bro might have two attacks at their disposal; a simple hammer throw, and an unwieldy but devastating hammer whack! . The throw has no traits modifying its required check, so it automatically works to deal damage equal to their Power, with a Nice result it can deal twice that! . The whack is much more difficult; its traits have raised the required Grades four times! So a Great result deals damage equal to their Power, a Wonderful result deals twice that – and anything else fails outright! . ",

    "content": "Whenever a Technique would deal damage as part of a Strike, each Strike is modified by the user's Attack to get the Raw Damage. Then, that damage value is reduced by the defender's Defense, any applicable Resistances they have and any other damage reduction they might have (such as a player's Guarding), and that amount of damage is taken from the target's HP. Importantly, your Attack can be negative too! In this case, the Attack value is taken out of the Raw Damage, which might reduce it right down to 0! . ",

Earning an extra Grade on top of that allows them to deal up to [2 x Power], and act as a Solid Hit. Multi-Strike . Multi-Strike attacks split some of the force up between their hits, hitting the same target multiple times. Each Strike deals a portion of the attack's damage potential with each hit; as a general rule, each Strike should deal no more than than [Power] in damage. The user Strikes once, then can make one more Strike for each additional Grade of Success earned, but the total base damage of the split Strikes can't be more than [2 x Power]. Taking damage at any point during a Technique (such as from a Contact Trait) interrupts and cancels the Technique. If a Strike caused the user to take damage, the Strike still resolves before the Technique ends, but no more Strikes can be made. ",

    "content": "When defining Techniques you have a wide variety of Traits to modify them with, which either increase or decrease the Technique's final FP cost. If this reduces your FP cost to 0 or less, the Technique doesn't cost any FP! . Tech Defaults are especially useful here – you can add on one of your available Tech Default sets without modifying the FP cost at all! Any Optional Tech Defaults which would apply can be added on as well without FP. Required Tech Defaults must be added where they would apply, and don't modify FP. Some Traits can be taken multiple times, layering together to enhance their effects. If two instances of the same Trait have different qualities (e.g. different elements, or targeted stats), count them as separate distinct Traits. While you can stack as many Traits on a Techniqe as you please, there are limits to how much FP you can save with negative Traits. You can only save FP from 3 Traits at a time, plus one more Trait for every 2 of your levels. Any other negative Traits you add contribute to the overall Technique's effect, but don't modify FP at all. Example: Negative Traits . A level 1 Buzzy Beetle wants to begin play with a powerful 0 FP attack. They add Strong for 2 FP, Overrun for 3 FP and Divider for 3 FP, allowing them to cleave through a group of foes and break their formation apart. 8 FP is a lot to swallow, though. They can use up to 3 negative Traits to try and mitigate this cost. After much deliberation, they decide on Exhausting (-4 FP), Penalty (-2 FP) and Unwieldy (-2 FP), giving them an all-or-nothing attack that's difficult to execute, and leaves them Dazed afterwards. They could add more negative Traits if they really wanted, but they wouldn't be able to save any more FP from those Traits. While you can describe a Technique in shorthand by referring to its Traits, in practice it's better to write out the full effect for your own reference – you may not always remember that a Piercing attack ignores Defense, or you may need to record how your Boost Technique works at different Grades of Success. Don't be disheartened if all these Technique Traits are overwhelming; the sheer volume of choices and interaction between different Traits is enough to make anyone's head spin. If you're having trouble creating your perfect Technique, talk to your GM about it and see what you can come up with together. These rules are a good starting point, but should never get in the way of a fun idea. ",

    "content": "Some Traits have similar functions which are referred to in shorthand, explained here. [X] . This Trait can be chosen multiple times to strengthen its effects; additional instances are treated as the same singular Trait, but with effects varying based on how many times the Trait has been taken, [X]. If there's a limit on how many times it can be taken, this is referred to as the Cap; the total number of copies of that Trait active at any one time must always be equal to or less than the Cap. [Secondary] . After the Primary Check is resolved, as long as it didn't fail and there's still a valid target, some Techniques have follow-up effects which require a Secondary Check. Unlike Primary Checks, the minimum floor for a Secondary Check to proceed is a Nice result. The required Skill is defined by your Traits – if a [Secondary] Trait lists multiple Skills, choose one of them when you first define the Technique, and if the Technique has multiple [Secondary] Traits, choose one skill to represent all Secondary effects. In any case, you only roll one Secondary Check for all relevant effects. If multiple targets would be affected, they all suffer the consequences of the same Secondary Check. [Approach] . This Trait modifies the way the user approaches their target(s). Generally, multiple [Approach] Traits can't be taken at once. [Target] . This Trait modifies the available targets for this Technique in some way. Generally, multiple [Target] Traits can't be taken at once. [Strikes] . This Trait modifies the way Strikes and damage are allocated in some way, making it fundamentally different from a Single-Strike or Multi-Strike Technique. Generally, multiple Strikes Traits can't be taken at once. [Random] . This Trait features a random element. Multiple [Random] Traits can't be taken at once, unless otherwise specified. [Slots] . This Trait includes Technique Slots, a smaller compartmentalised collection of Technique Traits. The exact number and nature of these slots depends on the Technique Trait. Unless otherwise specified, Technique Slots calculate their FP cost separately from the overall Technique; rather than paying the FP Cost of the slot, it's used to determine the Technique's FP cost. When calculated in this way, each individual Technique Slot can benefit from the same number of negative Traits that the Technique itself would, but can't benefit from any Tech Defaults. For the purpose of [X] Caps and duplicating Traits, Slots ignore all Traits in other Slots. ",

    "title": "Positive Technique Traits",
    "content": "Aerial (+2 FP) [Approach] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. The user flies through the air to deliver this attack, striking from above. This allows them to hit targets from anywhere in the fight, though they may struggle to hit targets who are blocked in some way (e.g. under a low ceiling). If the user is flying when they make an Aerial attack, they can Plummet as they make this attack. Plummeting attacks are made at +1 Power, but require one more Grade of Success on their Primary Check. Regardless of the outcome, the user becomes grounded after a Plummeting attack. All (+3 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all available targets, be they friend or foe, besides the user. At the user's option this can also include the Indirect Trait for no additional cost. Allies (+2 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all of the user's allies, but not themselves. At the user's option this can also include the Indirect Trait for no additional cost. Alt-Cost (+2 FP) . Choose HP, SP or Coins: . | HP: This Technique spends HP instead of FP. It can't recover HP, and can't be combined with Blowback or varieties of Self that deal damage to the user. | SP: This Technique spends SP instead of FP. It can't add SP to anyone's pool, though it can still generate SP for Exceptional Techniques. | Coins: This Technique spends 5 Coins for every 1 FP it would cost. It can't steal Coins through Snatch, and can't cover an equivalent cost of more than 10 FP (for 50 Coins). | . The effective FP cost can't be reduced lower than 1 FP by negative Traits while using Alt-Cost. Bestow (+2 FP) [Secondary – Bully/Cheer/Knowhow/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target temporarily acquires a Personal Trait of your choice, as if they were Enchanted, lasting for [X] turns. The exact Personal Traits added by this Trait are decided when this Trait is bought, and any special effects (such as an added Weakness) should be in line with similar effects. If the trait requires an action or check to activate (such as to take flight with Fly), it uses your action, and the results of your Secondary Check. Numerical values of the Trait (e.g. Resist, Contact damage, Status Level) are all set to 1, even if they would normally be higher. For every additional Grade of Success, incrase those numerical values by 1, to a maximum of [X]. The target must pay FP costs for their Traits as normal. If this Technique doesn't have Variant, and it uses Cheer for its skill check, this effect can only be used to add positive Traits to allies (e.g. Fly). Otherwise if it doesn't have Variant, and it uses Bully or Trickery for its skill check, this effect can only be used on enemies to add negative Traits (e.g. Weakness). Boost (+2 FP) [Secondary - Cheer/Heal/Magic] [X] . The target's abilities are Boosted for [X] turns – the exact abilities affected by the Boost are decided when this Trait is bought. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. This Technique can also use the following skills for Secondary Checks, depending on the ability being Boosted: . | Attack: Athletics or Coordination | Defense: Guard | Dodge: Trickery | Skill (e.g. Steady): The same Skill being Boosted | . If this Boost Technique has an element, it also has the following effects depending on the ability Boosted: . | Attack: The target's attacks have the same element for the duration. | Defense: The target's Resist for that element is Boosted, too. | . Burst (+1 FP) [Strikes] [Target] [X] . This attack bursts either side of its initial target, reaching to strike the next [X] additional targets in front of them and the next [X] additional targets behind them, regarless of their elevation. The initial target takes damage equal to [Power], or with an additional Grade of Success [2 x Power]. Each new target (in either direction) is deal 1 less Raw Damage than the last; this can't reduce the Raw Damage below 0, so as long as the first strike could deal damage, the rest will deal at least 1 Raw Damage. If it has no other element, the user can optionally give this Technique Element (Blast). Charm (+2 FP) [Secondary - Magic/Persuade/Trickery] [X] . The target is Charmed, causing them to be easily persuaded, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. An enemy Charmed is an enemy you don't have to deal with, and an asset to fight your enemies! Charm is an invaluable asset outside of combat, too – try using it to get past security, or negotiate a better deal. Just don't be surprised if they're made when your Charm wears off. Coin Toss (+? FP) [Random] [Slots] . This Technique has 2 different Technique Slots, each assigned either Heads or Tails. When you use this Technique, flip a coin. Only the Slot whose side comes up is active for this use of the Technique, and the other Slot's Traits are ignored. The overall FP cost Coin Toss adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | ½ of the highest positive FP cost in both Slots; if there's a tie, choose one. | +1 FP for each Trait included in the Slot with the most Traits. | -1 FP if one of the Slots is empty. | If either Slot has a negative FP cost, take ½ of away from Coin Toss' FP cost. | . If after this Coin Toss would have a negative FP cost, you can treat it as a negative Trait instead. Example: Heads or Tails . A gambling Shy Guy spins into a wild, uncontrolled kick! Essentially, they flip a coin; if it comes up Heads, they can add Strong to their kick! If it comes up Tails, though, they Exhaust themselves instead. With Heads, Strong would normally cost 2 FP, so that's +1 FP to the cost. With Tails, Exhausting would save -4 FP; so -2 FP overall. Both sides have the same number of Traits, so they add +1 FP for 1 Trait. The gambler's kick is so risky, it works out to 0 FP overall! . Counter (+2 FP) [X - Cap 3] . If this Technique has a Primary Check, it defaults to either Athletics or Steady. Instead of the usual effect of this Technique, the target gains the damage and other qualities of this Technique (excluding Counter, [Approach] and [Target] traits) as a Contact Trait, either through some direct hazard or a counter-attack from the original user. Ordinarily this Contact Trait persists until the next round, until it's triggered, or until the target takes damage. Choose up to [X] of the following effects when you design this Technique: . | This Contact Traits persists for [X] rounds, +1 round for each Grade of Success earned on the Primary Check. The trait persist when taking damage, and can be triggered multiple times. | This Contact Trait still activates when struck indirectly. | The target is rendered Secure by their Contact Trait as they intercept and keep foes at bay. If their Secure state ends (e.g. by attacking), so does the Contact Trait. | . Primary and Secondary Checks for this Technique are rolled once when the Technique is used. Whenever the Contact Trait is triggered, the effects of those rolls are applied to the attacker. Confuse (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Confused, causing them to behave unpredictably, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Daze (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Dazed for [X] turns, preventing them from fighting back. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Dazing an enemy stops even the most dangerous foes in their tracks! If you coordinate with your allies and make sure their attacks don't rouse the Dazed enemy, you can buy yourselves a lot of time. Disarm (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Disarmed for [X] turns, preventing them from using the targeted attack or Trait – the exact Traits (e.g. Tool) or manner of attack (e.g. jump attacks) affected by this status are decided when this Trait is chosen. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Dismiss (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Heal/Magic/Trickery] . For each Grade of Success, the user can choose one of the target's Statuses, their current Power-Up or a temporary Terrain affecting them. | Statuses or Terrain: Reduce duration by -1 for each Grade of Success this Technique earned overall. | Power-Up: The target must try to hold onto their Power-Up, as if they took damage; their check requires an additional Grade of Success for each Grade of Success this Secondary Check earned overall. | . If this Technique doesn't have Variant, and it uses Heal for its skill check, this effect can only be used to remove negative effects from allies (e.g. Weaken, debilitating Terrain). Otherwise if it doesn't have Variant, and it uses Bully or Trickery for its skill check, this effect can only be used on enemies to remove positive effects (e.g. Boost, Power-Ups, enhancing Terrain). Disorient (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Disoriented for [X] turns, reducing the effectiveness of all actions requiring their senses. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Divider (+3 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is cut off from their allies, separating into another distinct group for at least the next [X] full rounds – or until they can reasonably reconnect with the original group. If there are multiple targets, they can be divided into separate groups, creating up to 1 other group for each additional Grade of Success and a maximum of [X] new groups. If multiple targets are divided into the same group, they maintain their relative position and turn order in the new group. Drain (+3 FP) [X – Cap 2] . This attack's Strikes heal the user an amount of HP equal to ½ the damage dealt to one of its targets; if [X] is 2, it heals that amount in HP instead. As long as the Strike dealt damage, it heals a minimum of 1 HP. Each additional target damaged by a Drain attack adds +1 HP to the total healing. Element (+1 FP) [X] . This attack carries up to [X] different elemental qualities, such as Fire, Ice or Shock. If it has multiple elements, they all apply at the same time. Elements don't do anything on their own, but they can be useful in different situations. Note that Immunities apply before Weaknesses, and Immunities and Weaknesses each overrule Resistances. So if one element would trigger an enemy's Immunity, the whole Technique does. Empower (+2 FP) [X] . As long as this Technique's Secondary Check succeeds, it functions as if it had [X] additional Grades of Success. Fear (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Trickery] [X] . An affected target chooses between the below effects: . | They attempt to flee the fight. | They become Stunned for [X] turns. | Their Attack is Weakened for [X] turns. | . For every additional Grade of Success increase the Status Level of a Status inflicted by this Trait by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Flowery (+2 FP) [Secondary - Cheer/Magic] [X] . This Technique restores +1 FP to the target for every Grade of Success, to a maximum of [X] FP. Group (+5 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all targets in the chosen group. If targeting their own group, the user can choose whether or not it affects them too. At the user's option this can include the Indirect Trait. Hearty (+1 FP) [Secondary - Heal/Magic] [X] . This Technique heals the target 2 HP for every Grade of Success, to a maximum of [X+X] HP. Homing (+1 FP) . This Technique can't be Dodged and ignores the Secure Status. It can still be Guarded against. If a target has any Mirages in battle, this Technique can ignore them to strike the target instead. Hustle (+6 FP) [Secondary - Athletics/Cheer/Magic][X - Cap 5] . The target begins to Hustle, giving them additional actions for the next [X] full turns; if you begin to Hustle during your turn, this effect doesn't apply until your next turn. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Indirect (+2 FP) . This attack doesn't strike the target directly. The user is generally shielded from the consequences of the target's Contact Traits, though depending on the attack and the Contact trait there are exceptions. Launch (+2 FP) [Secondary - Athletics/Bully] [X] . The target is launched across the battlefield after being attacked, flying through one valid target in the same group behind them (at the same elevation) for each Grade of Success. If they collide with a target with a relevant Contact trait, they stop flying and suffer the consequences of that Contact. Each additional target hit during this launch takes damage equal to this Technique's Power, unmodified by the user's Attack; if the launched target has a relevant Contact trait, each new target suffers the consequences of that Contact. A maximum of [X] targets can be launched by this Technique at once, with all launches being resolved simultaneously. Afterwards, all targets return to their original position, if able – although in precarious fights, a solid enough launcher could shift the battlefield completely, or bring the fight to an early close. Lengthen (+1 FP) [X] . The innate effects of this Technique which have a duration (e.g. Statuses, Minions, Terrains) last [X] more turns or rounds, as appropriate. This does not impact effects generated from other sources, or after the Technique resolves (e.g. Exceptional Techniques, Weaknesses). Lingering (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic] [X] . The target suffers a Lingering burn, poison or other degenerative effect, for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Lucky Hit (+? FP) [Random] [Slots] . This Technique has a rare special effect! Add a single Technique Slot to this Technique; its overall FP Cost must be positive. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6; the Lucky Hit Slot's Traits are only active if you roll a 6. The overall FP cost Lucky Hit adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | 1/3 of the overall FP cost. | +1 FP for each pair of Traits included in the Slot, including copies of the same Trait. | . Example: Lucky Critical . A roguish Swooper strikes from the shadows! Their attack has a 1 in 6 chance to land a devastating Lucky Hit! . The Lucky Slot contains 4 instances of Strong, which would normally cost 8 FP. This cost is divided by 3 and rounded down, for 2 FP. Since it contains 4 Traits (two pairs), another +2 FP is added. Overall, this Lucky Hit costs 4 FP – half the usual cost! . Unlike other [Random] traits, you can combine Lucky Hit with Fumble. If the Technique has both traits, roll the same die once for both effects. You know what they say; better lucky than good. Minion (+3 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Cheer/Magic/Persuade] [Target] [X] . This Technique generates minions who obey your command. A successful use of this Technique earns 1 minion Tier, with additional Grades of Success earning one more Tier, to a max of [X] Tiers. You can then allocate those Tiers to generate any number of minions of the same Tier, allowing you to summon one strong minion at Tier [X], or a combination of weaker minions at a lower Tier. Generated minions join your group in any position you choose, and then become this Technique's target, taking on all other effects of this Technique (including damage, if applicable). Importantly, you design your minions separately for each tier when you design this Technique. Your Tier 1 minions always use the same qualities, your Tier 2 minions will always use the same qualities to generate a different, more capable, minion, and so on. Example: Goomba Stacking Minions . A Goomba monarch summons a horde of Goombas to serve as his minions! . Their Technique has Minion x3, allowing them to summon up to Tier 3 minions. They've previously defined Tier 1 (required a Nice result) as a simple Goomba, Tier 2 (Good) as a Paragoomba and Tier 3 (Great) as a Big Goomba. With a Great result he can generate a Tier 3 Big Goomba! Alternatively he could generate a Tier 2 Paragoomba, or up to 3 Tier 1 Goombas. Because each generated minion has to be the same Tier, though, he wouldn't be able to generate another combination of 3 Tiers (like a Goomba and a Paragoomba). Minions don't act during the round they're summoned, and persist for the next [X] full rounds. If they would have the Elevation, Fly or similar movement Traits, they can be generated with these active with no further action required. Minions follow your orders, acting in turn order as usual. They have one Innate Technique, and can reliably use their Personal Traits, but besides that they can't take on complicated tasks which would normally require a skill check (e.g. Crafts, Guard, Notice). For those actions they can carry out, minions automatically score a number of Grades of Success on all of their checks equal to their Tier. Since htey don't make checks themselves, they can't generate SP, and they're unable to hold or use SP themselves (even for Exceptional Techniques. Each Tier of minion can allocate up to 5 times their Tier in points to any of the below qualities: . Health . Minions receive 2 HP for every 1 point assigned. Just like regular characters, minions can't restore HP beyond their maximum. They begin with just 1 HP, with a cap of 5 HP times their Tier. Combat Ability . Minions receive 1 Power or 1 Defense for every 1 point assigned. Minions begin with 0 Power and 0 Defense, with a cap of ½ their Tier in either stat. Technique Offsets . The minion's Technique has -1 FP cost for each point assigned. The final FP cost must be 0 for it to be used, and can't be offset by Traits like Alt-Cost. A minion's Technique can have up to twice their Tier in positive Technique Traits and up to their Tier in negative Technique Traits, but [X] can never be higher than their Tier. Since Minions don't roll Primary or Secondary Checks, they can't use Traits which modify their required Grades – like Simple, Commitment, Lacking or Unwieldy. Traits which add or benefit from higher results – like Empower or Scaling – can still be used. Traits . Minions acquire a new Personal Trait for every 2 points assigned, with a Trait cap equal to their Tier. Any numerical effects (e.g. damage Resisted or HP restored) are limited to a cap of ½ the minion's Tier. Distinct copies of the same Trait (e.g. Immune (Blast) and Immune (Fire)) must be paid for and added separately, and any effects of these Traits which need to be defined (such as an immunity that restores HP) are tailored to suit the minion – though they should always be similar in scope to existing Traits. Minions can also add negative Traits (e.g. Weakness) without paying for them, with a negative Trait cap equal to their Tier. Each Trait added in this way offsets the cost of their other Personal Traits, making them free to add. Minions can get pretty complicated. If you don't want to overthink things, a bunch of Tier 1 minions is usually just as good as one high Tier minion. Many hands make light work! . Overrun (+3 FP) [Target] . This Technique affects all targets in the target group at the same elevation, as long as the user can reach that height before attacking (such as by flight, elevation or even just jumping). Piercing (+3 FP) . This attack ignores Defense, though it's still affected by Resistances and Immunities. It can still be Guarded against. Provoke (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery/Persuade] [X] . The target becomes Provoked, causing them to focus their attention on a particular valid target (specified by you), for [X] turns. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X+X]. Quake (+3 FP) [Approach] [Target] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. This attack affects all targets in the chosen group (besides the user) in contact with the ground, wall or ceiling. As a result, it also functions as the Indirect Trait and, if it has no other element, has Element (Earth) and Element(Quake). Ranged (+2 FP) [Approach] . This Technique's Primary Check defaults to Aim. This Technique can affect its targets in battle without making contact, regardless of their relative position or other targets in the way. Reach (+1 FP) [Approach] . This Technique can target flying and grounded enemies that aren't blocked by another target, as if the user was at their elevation. It still makes contact unless paired with Indirect. Repeat (+3 FP) [Strikes] . The user repeatedly attacks with a flurry of blows. They strike once, then one more time for each additional Grade of Success earned. The first Strike deals Raw Damage equal to [Power], to a minimum of 1 damage. Each successive Strike then deals 1 less damage than the last, to a minimum of 1 damage (as long as the last Strike dealt some amount of damage). This damage penalty is applied after Attack, Defense and other resistances are factored in, so as long as the first strike deals damage, each follow-up hit will deal at least 1 damage. There's no limit to the number of Strikes that can be made. Revive (+10 FP) [Secondary - Heal/Magic] . The target is revived from their KO with 1 HP (in addition to any HP they would gain from this Technique), and if they haven't already acted this round, they can act during their turn or immediately after the user's turn (whichever would come later or be more appropriate). If for whatever reason this Technique would deal damage, it's dealt after they're revived and healed, and the target can resist as normal. Roulette (+? FP) [Random] [Slots] . This Technique has 6 different Roulette Slots of Technique Traits, each with a different number between 1 and 6 assigned to them. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6. Only the Slot whose number is rolled is active for this use of the Technique, and all other Roulette Slot Traits are ignored. The overall FP cost Roulette adds to your Technique is equal to the sum of the following: . | The highest FP cost in all your Roulette Slots (to a minimum of 0 FP); don't factor in the FP cost for any other Slots. | +1 FP for each pair of Trait included in the Roulette Slot with the most Traits (both positive and negative). | For each Slot with a negative FP cost, take ½ the FP cost of that Slot or -1 FP (whichever reduces FP more) away from the total. | . If after this Roulette would have a negative FP cost, you can treat it as a negative Trait instead. Example: Elemental Roulette . A Magikoopa conjures a blast of prismatic energy, shifting between 6 different elements at random. Each Roulette Slot has a different Element Trait, but no other Traits. The magician only has to pay for one of those Roulette Slots (costing 1 FP). They only have one trait per slot, so they don't have to add any more FP to the cost! Thus, Roulette would add +1 FP for one Element, instead of the +6 FP normally paid for each Element added together. Why settle for one versatile and useful Technique when you could have six useless gimmicks that you have no control over? The Roulette spinner's world is limitless. Safe (+2 FP) . This Trait can only be applied to multi-target attacks. The user and their allies are shielded from the negative consequences of this attack (e.g. damage). Scaling (+3 FP) [X] . When resolving this Technique's Primary Check, once the maximum result is earned each additional Grade of Success beyond that point increases its Power by +1. This additional Power cannot be used to increase the number of Strikes. Can't be combined with Techniques with no effective maximum (e.g. Repeat, Sequential). Example: Devastating Scaling . A single-strike 1 Power hammer whack can deal a maximum of 2 DMG with a Nice result; inwhich case, Scaling would start to add Power with Good results and above, adding +2 damage at each step. A multi-hitting 2 Power slap attack would typically max out with 4 Strikes, each dealing 1 DMG, with a Great result; Scaling could still add Power and increase the total pool of damage dealt, but it can't add Strikes. So a Wonderful result might add +1 DMG to 2 strikes, an Excellent might add +1 DMG to 2 other Strikes, and so on. Secure (+4 FP) [Secondary - Guard/Magic/Trickery] . The target becomes Secure, rendering them completely immune to most Techniques targeting them for 1 turn; if this Technique would deal damage to or inflict status on the target, those effects take priority first. Selective (+1 FP) [Target] . This Technique can target any one foe at the same elevation as the user, regardless of blocking or their relative position. Sequential (+1 FP) [Strikes] [Target] . The user Strikes their target once, then moves to and attacks the next foe behind them with another Strike. Each additional Grade of Success adds another target and another Strike in the same manner. Each Strike deals [Power] damage. Each target is struck one after another, and can be attacked in melee even if they would normally be blocked by a previously struck foe. Shared (+1 FP) . The user can share in all or part of the effects of this Technique's Secondary Check, as if they were targeted by it. If the Technique would have targeted them anyway, they don't receive any additional benefit; they're only added as a target. Simple (+2 FP) [X] . This Technique is easier to use, acting as if it scored [X] additional Grades of Success on the Primary Check; if the maximum effectiveness can be reached with only those Grades, then the user can choose to forego their roll for the Primary Check. Snatch (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Trickery] . Based on the number of Grades of Success, you can choose to take one of the following from the target (if they have something to take): . | Nice!: 1d6 Coins for each Grade of Success. | Good!: A small Item | Great!: A large Item | Wonderful!: An equipped Item, such as a Tool or a Badge | . If multiple targets would be affected by this Technique, you can attempt to steal from each of them by dividing the total Grades of Success between all applicable targets. Players can oppose this check with Athletics, Coordination or Steady. Example: Multi-Snatch . An Overrun Snatch that affected three targets with a Wonderful result could assign two Grades of Success to one target (stealing a small Item), and split up the remaining two Grades of Success to steal from the other targets (stealing 1d6 Coins from each). A little bit of tactical thievery can go a long way over the course of an adventure. You never know what cool items you could be missing out on! . Spillover (+2 FP) [Target] . This Technique initially targets a single valid target. If one of its Strikes deals enough damage to KO its initial target, you can re-allocate the excess damage and any additional Strikes to another valid target. Continue on until all of this Technique's Raw Damage and Strikes have been allocated. If a Strike from this Technique would be a Solid Hit, all damage allocated once it spills over is still treated as a Solid Hit. Split (+2 FP) [Slots] . This Technique can include any number of Technique Slots; any slot added by this trait is treated as a Split Slot. Unlike other [Slots] Traits, the traits included in a Split Slot are calculated exactly as if they were outside that slot; they contribute to the Technique's FP cost and can include Tech Defaults, as normal. Any Trait or Strike left outside of a Split Slot is directed at the Technique's original target(s). Each Split Slot can include its own [Approach] and [Target] traits, and one or more of the Technique's Strikes can be allocated to that slot. If a Split Slot no [Approach] or [Target] traits on its own, it defaults to the same targeting options as the main Technique. Whenever you use this Technique, your Split Slots and the main Technique resolve in order, allocating targets as your direct. The exact order everything resolves is defined by you when you design this Technique. Any Primary and Secondary checks required are shared between Split Slots, as normal. A Split Slot can't contain the Harmless Trait; but if it has no Strikes it deals no damage, exactly as if it was Harmless. Example: Splitting your Harming and Healing . Split gives you a lot of versatility in designing your Techniques; for a simple example, you could deal damage to a foe while healing your allies! . To do this with Split, you would need to include the traits Hearty and Allies, then assign them to a Split Slot. You want the healing to trigger after you make your attack, so you have the bulk of the Technique resolve first, then the Split Slot afterwards. The Technique could then be used to attack a single target in melee (as normal for a Technique without a [Target] trait). Afterwards, your allies would receive the HP recovered from Hearty! . Strike-Through (+1 FP) [Strikes] [Target] [X] . This attack pierces past its initial target to strike the next [X] additional targets at the same elevation. The first target takes [Power] damage, or [2 x Power] as a Solid Hit with an additional Grade of Success. The attack then repeats with a Strike on up to [X] valid targets behind the first, at the same elevation. Each new Strike deals 1 less Raw Damage than the last; this can't reduce the Raw Damage below 0, so as long as the first strike could deal damage, the rest will deal at least 1 Raw Damage. If the initial Strike was a Solid Hit, the subsequent Strikes are too. Strong (+2 FP) [X] . This Technique has +[X] Power. Stun (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target is Stunned for [X] turns, stopped dead in their tracks. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X+X]. Swap (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Coordination/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target swaps position with another target in the same group as you direct, maintaining their current elevation where possible. The second target can't be further away in group order than 1 space for each Grade of Success, to a maximum of [X] spaces away. If this Technique affects multiple targets, each target can only be swapped once. Terrain (+3 FP) [Secondary - Crafts/Magic] [X] . The environment around the target shifts for [X] full rounds, causing a Terrain to form around them. The exact Terrain this Technique causes is chosen when this Trait is bought. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Terrain Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. If the target is already in a similar Terrain (e.g. both Terrains are Weathers), the new Terrain overrides the old one for the duration. Throw (+2 FP) [Target] [Strikes] [X - Cap 2] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. The target is bodily hurled into the next available target. Both targets are struck at once, and trigger any Contact Traits the other target has. Each target takes [Power] damage, or [2 x Power] as a Solid Hit with an additional Grade of Success. If this Technique has a Secondary Check that would affect the original target, it affects the new target as well. If [X] is 2, you can aim the target as if with the Ranged Trait, and can use Aim as the Primary Check. Tool (+1 FP) . This Technique relies on a hand-held tool, such as a hammer or staff, and can't be used if the appropriate equipment isn't available. As a result it also has Indirect or Ranged, at the user's option. The Basic Gear used for these Techniques don't cost anything during character creation, but they take up an inventory slot, and replacements may need to be bought. Ammunition isn't tracked; if a Tool is represented by a large number of disposable equipment (such as throwing weapons), one Tool is enough to represent the user's supply. Built-In Tools (used by Constructs) are functionally the same as Tools, but are built into the user's body. They still take up an inventory slot. Tools are the easiest way to keep your distance in a fight. If you don't want to dedicate a Technique to a simple attack, why not try picking up some Gear? . Tutor (+1 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Cheer/Knowhow/Magic] [X] . Choose up to [X] of this Technique's Traits; multiple instances of a Trait (e.g. Lingering x2) must be selected individually (requiring you to select both instances of Lingering). Those Traits have no effect on this Technique, and the target instead becomes Tutored in their use for [X] turns; for each additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. Depending on the exact nature of the Traits being Tutored and how the tutelage is carried out, you may also be Disarmed when trying to use relevant Techniques for the same duration (e.g. if you Tutor someone in Tool by handing them your equipment). If the Tutored Traits are negative, any FP that would be saved by them instead becomes a positive value (e.g. Unwieldy goes from -2 FP to +2 FP). If this Technique doesn't have Variant, and it uses Cheer for its skill check, you must include at least one positive Trait. Otherwise if it doesn't have Variant, and it uses Bully for its skill check, you can't include any positive Traits. Underfoot (+2 FP) [Approach] [Target] . At the user's option, this Technique's Primary Check can use Athletics instead. This Technique comes from the ground, affecting all targets in the target group in contact with the ground, besides the user. As a result, it also functions as the Indirect Trait and, if it has no other element, has Element (Earth) and/or Element (Quake). Variant (+1 FP) [X - Cap 2] . You may choose a different skill to use for either your Primary or Secondary check for this Technique. Versatile (+3 FP) [X] [Slots] . This Technique has up to [X] different Versatile Slots full of Technique Traits. Track the FP cost of each Versatile Slot separately. When you use this Technique, you can choose one of your Versatile Slots. Only the chosen Slot is active, and the Technique's FP cost is temporarily modified by that Slot's FP Cost. All unchosen Versatile Slots are ignored. Example: Versatile Casting . A Shaman from the mountains has mastered a magical Technique which turns the might of the mountain upon their foes, using two Versatile Slots. The overall Technique has Element (+1 FP); now even if they don't choose a Versatile SLot, their Technique still innately deals Earth damage. The cost of each Versatile Slot must also be paid (+6 FP), and they choose to add Variant (+1 FP) to rely on their superior Magic skill. At first level they have access to 3 negative traits to save FP, so they add Unwieldy x2 (-4 FP) and Commitment (-2 FP), for a base cost of 2 FP. In the first Slot they add All (+3 FP), Strong x2 (+4 FP) and Blowback (-4 FP), for a total of +3 FP – representing boulders raining down. In the second Slot they add Underfoot (+2 FP), Piercing (+3 FP) and Exhausting (-4 FP), for a total of +1 FP – representing geysers bursting out from underneath their enemies. Even though they used 3 negative traits earlier, each Slot has the same limit of 3 negative traits, allowing them to save even more FP on each Slot! The end result is a Technique which can strike one foe in melee (2 FP), rain boulders from above (5 FP) or strike with geysers from below (3 FP). Weaken (+2 FP) [Secondary - Bully/Magic/Trickery] [X] . The target's abilities are Weakened for [X] turns – the exact abilities affected by the Weakening are decided when this Trait is chosen. For every additional Grade of Success, increase the Status Level by 1, to a maximum of [X]. If you're confident you can hit your targets, Scaling and Strong combo well with Unwieldy to make your attacks much more powerful! Consider adding these traits on as you level up and get better at making checks. ",

    "content": "Blowback (-4 FP) . After finishing this attack, the user loses HP equal to ½ the Raw Damage this attack would deal to a single target; if there's a range of different damage totals, refer to the highest Raw Damage potential possible. If this attack would affect the target with a Secondary Check, the user is affected as well, though they can resist with Steady as normal. The user's HP loss can't be resisted in any way (including Defense, Safe or Secure) and ignores the user's Weaknesses, Resistances or Immunities. This Trait cannot be combined with Harmless or Self. Commitment (-2 FP) [X - Cap 2] . Choose Primary Check or Secondary Check: . | Primary: This Technique's Primary Check fails unless its maximum possible effectiveness is achieved, and no higher roll is possible. Can't be combined with Traits that have no functional maximum (e.g. Repeat, Scaling, Sequential), or Techniques without a useable reduced state (e.g. 0 Power). | Secondary: This Technique's Secondary Check only works if the maximum possible result is achieved. You can't combine this effect with a Secondary Check that only has one potential outcome, (e.g. Nice! with no benefits for a Good! result), or a Team effect which has no additional benefit for extra successes. | . The Technique must have a Primary or a Secondary Check in order for Commitment to be applied to either. Conditional (-1 FP) [X] . Choose up to [X] of this Technique's distinct Positive Traits; they only function in specific circumstances (e.g. midair, underwater), or against specific targets (e.g. Goombas, sleeping targets). If the Trait has multiple instances, this condition applies to all instances of that trait, and the specific circumstances are defined for each Trait separately. Otherwise, the Technique continues to function. The circumstances don't need to be extremely rare but they can't be so common as to almost always be applicable for the user (e.g. \"enemies that can breathe\"). Can't be combined with Situational effects involving the same circumstance. Cooldown (-1 FP) [X - Cap 5] . This Technique can't be used again until [X] of the user's actionable turns (i.e. turns where they otherwise could have used this Technique) have passed, counting from the next turn. Delayed (-2 FP) [X - Cap 5] . This Technique doesn't take effect immediately, instead being executed [X] rounds after it was used as a free action at the end of the round. Targets are declared, FP is spent and checks are rolled when this Technique is first used. If the target is invalid when the Technique is executed, it either targets the same area (if a valid target has taken the initial target's place), or fails. Instead of swapping with their allies, if a targeted character would swap under their own power, they can move the targeted space for this Technique the same distance – and can even move it outside of their group to completely dodge it. Drip-Feed (-1 FP) [X - Cap 5] . This Technique takes time to reach its full effect, instead dividing its Status Levels, HP restored and FP restored evenly over the course of the next [X+X] turns for all targets. Status Levels added on in this way are compounded with the existing Status, allowing it to gradually grow stronger without impacting the duration. If a target loses the effect of one of the Technique's Statuses before it reaches its full potential, the Status ends, and no more Status Levels are added on from this Trait. The Technique must have at least one effect (e.g. HP, FP or Status Level) with a value of [X+X] in order to stretch it out to that extent. If one of those effects is completely dealt out before [X+X] turns are up, stop assigning that effect to targets. If its effects can't be divided evenly, allocate any remainders to the first turn. Example: Gradual Boosting with Drip-Feed . Drip-Feed allows you to regenerate over time or slowly build up the effects of your Technique. For instance, a Boost (4) Status could be divided across four turns with Drip-Feed x2; providing Boost (1) upfront, Boost (2) the next turn, then Boost (3) and finally Boost (4). A shorter burst could be made with Drip-Feed x1, providing Boost (2) upfront, and Boost (4) the following turn. Exhausting (-4 FP) [X] . The user can't take any more actions for [X] turns. They can still talk, move around (without changing position), take part in other characters' actions (such as Team Techniques and swapping with Coordination), and can react freely. Fumble (-? FP) [Random] [Slots] . This Technique has a rare chance to backfire. Add a single Technique Slot to this Technique; its overall FP cost must be negative. When you use this Technique, roll 1d6; the Fumble Slot's Traits are suppressed, as long as you don't roll a 1. The amount of FP Fumble takes off of your Technique is equal to 1/3 of the Fumble Slot's FP cost. Example: Fumbled Attack . A Hammer Bro swings with a devastating melee attack – but their hammer is so heavy, it has a 1 in 6 chance to Fumble! . The Fumble Slot contains Harmless, and 6 instances of Penalty (Disarm (Tool)), which would normally save -9 FP. This cost is divided by 3, for -3 FP. When the Hammer Bro fumbles, they're unable to swing – and worse, they lose their grip on their hammer! . Unlike other [Random] traits, you can combine Lucky Hit with Fumble. If the Technique has both traits, roll the same die once for both effects. Harmless (-3 FP) [Strikes] . This Technique doesn't deal damage at all; it includes no Strikes, isn't affected by Attack and has no Primary Check, instead skipping to the Secondary Check (if applicable). Since it has no need to physically strike at the target, it can also include the Indirect Trait at the user's option for no added cost. This Trait can't be combined with Weak, or added to Split Slots with Split. Lots of iconic moves are best represented with Harmless effects! The option to trade away damage does a lot to mitigate expensive FP costs when you're stacking lots of traits. Lacking (-1 FP) [X] . Choose one of this Technique's distinct Positive Traits; it needs [X] additional Grades of Success in order to function, and is inactive if that threshold isn't met. If that Trait has multiple instances, this Lacking effect applies to all instances of that trait. If you have multiple instances of Lacking targeting different traits, you can split the additional [X] Grades of Success between them freely. This Trait can't save more FP than the target Trait's total FP cost. This Trait can't be added if it would raise the minimum floor for the overall success of relevant checks. Example: Lacking Status . If a Technique had both Lingering x3 and Daze x2, you could add Lacking (Daze) to require a Good result or higher for Daze to function. You couldn't then add Lacking (Lingering), because then the Secondary Check would require a Good result at minimum. Limitation (-? FP) . The positive effects of this Technique and the way it's used are restricted in some way not easily represented through other traits, such as to restrict Exceptional Techniques use, consume some of their Items for each use, or to force the user to make certain choices they wouldn't normally have to define. The exact amount of FP saved depends on the nature of this limitation and is ultimately up to the GM to decide on a case-by-case basis. -2 FP is recommended for most limitations, but especially harsh limitations might warrant a bigger discount. On the other hand, particularly lax limitations might be worth just -1 FP, if they qualify at all. While there's a lot of variety in Technique Traits, sometimes when you're going for a specific niche, it's difficult to get the effects just right. Limitations can help bridge this gap, but by their nature they're extremely open-ended. Be sure to discuss this trait with your GM first! . Others (-1 FP) [Target] . This Technique can only be used on one other willing target (e.g. allies), and not the user or their enemies. Penalty (-2 FP) [X - Cap 3] . Choose up to [X] negative Statuses when you add this Trait (e.g. Confused, Dazed, Disarmed, Disoriented, Lingering, Provoked, Stunned or Weakened). After this Technique resolves, you receive those Statuses with no opportunity to resist. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [X+X+X+X], and their duration is unaffected by Shorten. If you choose a Status you have an Immunity to, this effect bypasses that Immunity. You can reduce this Status with Steady in later turns, as normal for any Status. Self (-? FP) [Target] . This Technique can only be used on the user. If this Technique has Counter or Harmless, or if this trait is contained in a Split Slot with no Strikes, this trait is worth -1 FP. Otherwise, this trait is worth -2 FP for each point of Power in this Technique (after applying other Traits), and the user can't bypass or otherwise resist its damage through Immunities, Resistances, Secure or any other effect. Shorten (-1 FP) [X] . The effects of this Technique last for [X] less turns/rounds, to a minimum of 1. This Trait can't be added if it would have no further effect on the Technique's duration (e.g. if all durations are already reduced to 1 turn). Side-Effect (-2 FP) [X - Cap 3] . Choose up to [X] positive Statuses when you add this Trait (e.g. Boosted, Hustled or Secure). Before this Technique resolves, regardless of its check result, all targeted enemies receive that Status. The Status Level and duration of each Status added must add up to at least [X+X+X+X], their duration is unaffected by Shorten, and the Status Level can't exceed the maximum allowed for the Status (e.g. Secure can't go beyond Status Level 1). Any Status added with this Trait must be impactful and useful to a general enemy; Boost (Attack) would be fine for most cases, but something like Boost (Knowhow) would generally be too niche and require GM approval. Situational (-? FP) . Choose one: . | For -2 FP, choose one or more Common Situations which you might be reasonably expected to face, such as while in a specific State or while on the ground. In those situations, the Technique can't be used. | For -4 FP, choose an Uncommon Situation which is (typically) outside your control, such as while underwater or while the target is at full health. This Technique can't be used at all outside of that situation. | . Depending on the circumstances, a Situational Technique may even be able to work when any other Technique would be impossible – like a Technique that only works while sleeping! . Can't be combined with Conditional effects involving the same circumstances. Shady Koopas are infamous for their tricky backspin! Turning a weakness into a strength can make for a truly memorable Situational attack. Team (-2 FP) [Secondary - Coordination/Cheer] [X] . This Technique requires the user and [X] other allies to roll for this Technique's Secondary Check first, before the Primary Check is rolled; if any participant's roll fails to meet the Secondary Check's minimum requirements, the Technique fails. Otherwise, you can use the result of any other participant's Secondary Check in place of your Primary Check and/or your Secondary Check. If you replace your Primary Check in this way, don't roll for your own Primary Check. For the purposes of Exceptional Results and Exceptional Techniques, the user makes all decisions, but any generated SP goes to the character who made the check, and only the checks used for the final Technique can earn SP. Team Techniques aren't just a good way to save FP – they're also a great way to combine your strengths and connect with your allies! A team that fights together, stays together! . Unwieldy (-2 FP) [X] . This Technique requires [X] more Grades of Success to function; you can apply these additional requirements to either its Primary or Secondary checks freely. Weak (-2 FP) [X - Cap by Power] . This Technique has –[X] Power. This Trait cannot be combined with Harmless, and cannot reduce Power lower than 0. It can be tempting to only rely on the safest negative traits you can find, but there's a lot of fun flavour to be found when you work with some restrictions. Don't just look at them as a way to save FP, but as a key part of your Technique's stylistic flair! . ",

Some of the common varieties are listed here, but this list and the effects attributed to each Terrain are by no means exhaustive. Usually, all parties in battle are impacted by the Terrain, but it's possible through circumstance or Techniques for just a small area to be impacted.

Creating an imaginative solution that suits your game and your players will always be better than forcing players into a mould they're not interested in. The rest of this book is devoted to resources for you to use at your own table, and suggestions for how to tweak the provided rules for your players.

    "title": "NPC Inaction",
    "content": "A critical distinction between Paper Story and other systems you might have played is that Non-Player Characters (NPC's) don't follow any pre-defined rules – they just kind of work. NPC's only have very basic stats – HP and Defense is usually the only thing you need to consider, as well as how they attack the players (if they do). Essentially, NPC actions automatically succeed, and the players are the ones that have to respond to those actions. They represent the flow of the narrative for your game, so you just have to direct them as you see fit. They don't make attack checks, they don't contest player's actions, and they don't waste your time. In a combat scenario, all you need for an NPC is to track their key stats and the outcome of their attacks – which is usually just the number of strikes, the damage dealt and any Statuses they can dish out. By design, all of this is simple enough to mock up on the spot, but it can be really helpful to look at how the games have used enemies in battles and build off of that. You can give them FP, too, if you want the players to wear them down over time; usually though I'd recommend just spacing out their best attacks by a turn or two. If their FP total comes up (such as through a Point Swap), it's rare enough that it's easier to just come up with something on the fly. Statuses can be trickier, since it's easy for players to acquire powerful effects like Daze and Stun which can invalidate a lot of fights, especially boss fights. The easiest solution to make more resilient enemies is to take a couple levels off the status, or shorten the duration by a few turns, so that your players still get the satisfaction of using their status effects without de facto solving the encounter. If an NPC really poses a challenge (out-swimming a Cheep Cheep, or Bullying a mighty dragon), your players still make their rolls as normal, but you might want to warn them they'll need more Grades of Success. If you're not familiar with this style of play it can take some getting used to – I highly recommend Dungeon World and other Powered By The Apocalypse systems if you're interested in seeing that concept taken further, as it was a big inspiration for this system.

    "title": "Star Power Techniques",
    "content": "In a long-form campaign, players may acquire certain powers that rely on Star Power to function, from artifacts, powerful beings or whatever else fits within your campaign. With these boons comes an increase in maximum SP, improving SP limits by 10 with each ability. In the context of Paper Story, these are basically just Techniques which cost SP instead of FP, as defined by the GM. As these are more potent than regular Techniques and run on a less reliable power source, GM's are encouraged to set SP costs as they see fit, and homebrew effects as necessary. Some examples are provided below based on the existing games, to be taken as suggestions only. Traits used are provided as a reference, showing how they could potentially be designed as Techniques, and the relative power level when translated into FP. Simple rolls are generally assumed to succeed, however for debilitating Statuses and other effects where variance is useful, feel free to request relevant checks. Magic, Bully, Cheer and Perform are all useful skills to call in these circumstances, though that will vary based on the Technique and source of their power. Equivalent FP costs assume the Technique operates at 1 Power and automatically achieve their full potential. When used in-game it's recommended that these Techniques don't rely on the user's Power or Attack; usually, they just have set damage values. Keep in mind these are rough estimates, as many Star Power Techniques don't fit neatly into Paper Story's mechanics – generally, it's better for the GM to design Star Power Techniques from scratch, working as they see fit.

It deals up to the character's Power in damage with no successes, and up to twice that with a Nice result.

    "content": "Generally, navigating around the world can be handled on a scene-by-scene basis, with the GM describing the players' surroundings and the players asking clarifying questions or making actions to engage with the world. However, sometimes you want to move the exploration along a bit, or have the players carry out some exciting acrobatic feats deserving of a Mario game. These rules can be used to quickly navigate an area, abstracting a dungeon, \"level\" or other explorable area into a couple of rolls. Make sure you still describe their actions and the area they're exploring! Otherwise it's easy to feel like you're just making dice rolls. | All players make an Athletics check (or otherwise appropriate skill) on their own, representing their general ability to navigate the terrain. | With enough Grades of Success, they can make it through without difficulty. The exact amount needed would vary depending on the area they're exploring, but usually a Great result is a good start. | . | If players fail this check, they suffer some kind of complication; but ultimately, they should still make progress. | Depending on the area they're in and the pacing of the game, you might want to make this something small (like some damage, or dropping some Coins), but occasionally a big distraction can be fun – just keep in mind that anything too big is going to detract from the players that did succeed. | Usually this should require the players make another skill check (e.g. Steady to resist some hazard), make a choice, or engage in battle. Although if they almost succeeded, or it's only a minor complication, it's fine to just describe it and move along. | . | If players succeeded earlier, they can optionally make another check for some kind of reward, or to help players who are struggling. | This can be up to the player, but usually as the GM you'll want to present them with a choice between two things to do, or two routes they can go down. | The easiest thing to ask for here is a Notice check, giving players a chance to find Items or Coins. This is a good way to get small things to players that they might not have otherwise considered, like Mushrooms or crafting materials. | Another fun option can be Perform, giving players a chance to revel in their athleticism. This is basically an Appeal for SP. | Alternate, more difficult, paths could use Athletics, Coordination or Steady to traverse safely. These paths can lead to more rewards, bypass some enemies, or get to the end faster. | . | . Usually, that's enough to get through an area. But if players are lagging behind, or the area is particularly long or dangerous, you can consider asking for another check to navigate the area. There's a whole wide world out there!

    "content": "As an alternative to standard Paper Story, you may want to create a diverse cast of partners to assist one major character, much like in the N64 original. This may better suit a campaign where players control a variety of characters, or where many players may drop in and out, centred around one main figure. In the Partner System, in addition to ordinary characters (like Mario), there are simplified partner characters. Whenever a partner takes any amount of damage from an enemy, they act as if KO'd and sit out of the fight. At the start of each turn they restore 1 HP, and become active again when they're fully healed. If for whatever reason a partner takes enough damage to reduce their HP to 0, then as normal, they are rendered completely inactive, can't take any further actions and don't passively heal. Patners can't be attacked while in this state, though they may still take damage through other effects. While in this state, partners can take certain actions to help them recover faster. This still counts as their action for the turn. | Using Items on themselves. | Making Heal checks on themselves. | Getting a Second Wind with their SP. | . Under this system, a number of Badges change when used by partners, as noted on the following page. This system works well for a large number of partners, which may make things take longer and unbalance games. If this is a concern, you may want to restrict combat actions to one partner at a time (as in the games), or have a large group of partners in a loosely assembled formation behind their leader. In any case, it's not as flexible as standard play, and is only recommended for games focused on a central protagonist. Power Rush BadgeAttackPartner Behavior • 1 BP • 50 Coins .

Sometimes, being KO'd in the field of battle is a very real possibility – you should make sure players understand the risks, and try not to be too flippant with it. It's probably okay for a lengthy poison to drain someone's life away, or a particularly devastating attack to end their game – not so much a Goomba's headbonk. Even in these cases, it's best not to be too graphic, and let players form their own mental pictures to the level they're comfortable with. It's enough to explain that the dragon has eaten someone whole – you don't need to go into grisly detail about how it's playing out. And of course, the most important thing is to set the expectation with your players. As long as everyone knows what they're signing up for, it can providea different kind of fun. ",
